We know that each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese, so we can write:\nm + c = number of sandwiches\nWe also know that each sandwich serves 4 people and there will be 20 people in total, so we can write:\nnumber of sandwiches = 20/4\nnumber of sandwiches = 5\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives us:\nm + c = 5\nFinally, we know that the meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so the total cost will be:\ntotal cost = (cost per pound of meat x pounds of meat) + (cost per pound of cheese x pounds of cheese)\ntotal cost = (7m) + (3c)\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nWe need to solve the system of equations:\nm + c = 5\ntotal cost = (7m) + (3c)\nWe can use substitution to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for c in terms of m:\nc = 5 - m\nSubstituting this into the total cost equation gives us:\ntotal cost = (7m) + (3(5 - m))\ntotal cost = 7m + 15 - 3m\ntotal cost = 4m + 15\nNow we can plug in the value of m from the first equation:\nm + c = 5\nm + (5 - m) = 5\nc = 5 - m\nc = 5 - 2.5\nc = 2.5\nSo we need 2.5 pounds of cheese and 2.5 pounds of meat to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people. Plugging these values into the total cost equation gives us:\ntotal cost = (7 x 2.5) + (3 x 2.5)\ntotal cost = 17.5 + 7.5\ntotal cost = 25\nTherefore, the answer is 'the answer is $25.00'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

The formula is:\n\nn(A or B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A and B)\n\nLet A be the set of students who are good at math, and let B be the set of students who are good at English. We know that:\n\nn(A and B) = the number of students who are good at both math and English = ?\nn(A) = the number of students who are good at math only = 5\nn(B) = the number of students who are good at English only = 8\nn(A or B) = the total number of students = 20\n\nUsing the formula, we can solve for n(A):\n\nn(A or B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A and B)\n20 = 5 + 8 - n(A and B)\nn(A and B) = 13 - 20\nn(A and B) = 7\n\nSo, 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the number of students who are good at math only, we can subtract n(A and B) from n(A):\n\nn(A) = n(A only) + n(A and B)\n5 = n(A only) + 7\nn(A only) = -2\n\nThis doesn't make sense, so let's check our work. We know that n(A) cannot be negative, and it should also be less than or equal to 20 (the total number of students). This means that there must be an error in our calculations.\n\nLet's try another approach. We know that:\n\nn(A) = the number of students who are good at math only\nn(B) = the number of students who are good at English only\nn(A and B) = the number of students who are good at both math and English\nn(A or B) = the total number of students\n\nWe also know that:\n\nn(A or B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A and B)\n\nIf we rearrange this formula, we get:\n\nn(A) = n(A or B) - n(B) + n(A and B)\n\nWe can substitute the known values to get:\n\nn(A) = 20 - 8 + 7\nn(A) = 19\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the answer is 19\".\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Thus, the second friend pressed the doorbell x + (1/4)x = (5/4)x times.\nThe third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, who pressed on the doorbell 60 times. So the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.\nThe total number of doorbell rings is the sum of the doorbell rings made by each friend: x + (5/4)x + 60 + 70 = (9/4)x + 130.\nSince there were 4 friends, the total number of doorbell rings is also equal to the number of times the doorbell was pressed multiplied by 4.\nTherefore, (9/4)x + 130 = 4n, where n is the number of times the doorbell was pressed.\nSolving for x, we get x = (4n - 130) x (4/9).\nSince x is the number of doorbell rings made by the first friend, we need to find n, the number of times the doorbell was pressed. \nSubstituting x into our equation, we get (36/9)n - 520/9 + 130 = 4n.\nSimplifying this equation, we get (8/9)n = 390/9.\nThus, n = 390/8 = 48.75.\nTherefore, the answer is the doorbell rang 48.75 times, which is not a whole number and therefore may not be physically possible.

So the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 5% of the non-guaranteed candles, which is 0.05*(50000-49500) = 25. \n\nStep 2: \nTo find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to subtract the number of candles that only smell like wet dog or only explode from the total number of candles that both guaranteed not to explode and not smell like wet dog. \n- The number of candles that only smell like wet dog is 25. \n- The number of candles that only explode is x. \n- The number of candles that both guaranteed not to explode and not smell like wet dog is 49500 - x. \n\nSo the equation is: \n49500 - x - 25 - x = 50000 \n\nSimplifying: \n49475 - 2x = 50000 \n-2x = 525 \nx = -262.5 \n\nSince x cannot be negative, there are no candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: 'the answer is 0'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Then we can write:\n- Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. This means they each have 1/3 of their pizza left. So the number of slices they ate is 2/3 * 12p = 8p, and the number of slices left for each of them is 4p.\n- The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. This means they each have 1/4 of their pizza left. So the number of slices they ate is 3/4 * 12p = 9p, and the number of slices left for each of them is 3p.\n\nTo find the total number of slices left, we need to add up the slices left for all five people:\nTotal slices left = 4p (Bryce) + 4p (friend 1) + 4p (friend 2) + 3p (friend 3) + 3p (friend 4)\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nWe know that each person ordered one pizza, so p = 1. Substituting this into our equation for the total slices left, we get:\nTotal slices left = 4(1) + 4(1) + 4(1) + 3(1) + 3(1) = 18\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the number of slices of pizza left is 18'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

If they can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint a whole house in 10 days. We can express this as:\n\n1 person can paint 1 house in 10 days\n\nNow let's use this to find out how long it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. If 1 person can paint a house in 10 days, 5 people working together can paint the same house in 1/5th of the time. We can express this as:\n\n5 people can paint 1 house in 2 days\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nNow we just need to convert this into hours. If 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days, it means they can paint half a house in 1 day. Therefore, it would take them 1 day to paint a quarter of the house, and 4 days to paint the whole house. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can express this as:\n\nthe answer is 4 x 24 = 96 hours\n\nTherefore, it would take 5 people 96 hours to paint a whole house.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

We can do this by multiplying the number of holes dug per day by the number of days:\nTotal holes dug by the dog = 6 holes/day x 14 days = 84 holes\n\nNext, let's find how many holes Nate needs to fill in. We can do this by subtracting the number of holes dug by the dog from the total number of holes:\nHoles to fill in = Total holes - Holes dug by dog = 84 holes - 0 holes (since the dog keeps digging new holes every night) = 84 holes\n\nNow that we know how many holes Nate needs to fill in, we can find how long it will take him to fill them in. Let's let the number of weeks it takes be x. We can set up an equation based on the rate at which Nate fills in holes:\n\nHoles filled in by Nate = Nate's rate x time = 9 holes/day x number of days x number of weeks = 9x7x x = 63x\n\nWe know that the number of holes Nate fills in must equal the number of holes he needs to fill in, so we can set up another equation:\n\nHoles filled in by Nate = Holes to fill in = 84 holes\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following system of equations:\n\n63x = 84\n\nStep 2:\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 84/63 = 4/3\n\nSo the answer is: the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 4/3 weeks.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Let x be the number of times she bid before winning.\n\nThe three other people each bid once, so the number of total bids before Carmen won is 3 + x.\n\nEach bid increases by $50, so the cost of the desk after x bids is 200 + 50x.\n\nSince Carmen bid after each of the 3 other people, she bid a total of (3 + x) times.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the desk for Carmen is (3 + x)(50) + 200.\n\nTo find x, we know that Carmen bid until she won, so her final bid was enough to win the auction. This means her final bid was equal to the cost of the desk after x bids.\n\nSetting these two equations equal to each other, we get:\n\n(3 + x)(50) + 200 = 200 + 50x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n150 + 50x = 50x + 200\n\nSubtracting 50x from both sides, we get:\n\n150 = 200\n\nThis is not a true statement, so there is no solution for x.

However, we know that y must be a positive integer because the trader sold whole bags of wheat. We can use trial and error to find the solution.\n\nLet's start by assuming that the trader bought 1 bag of wheat from the farmer. The cost of buying and transporting the bag is 22 dollars. The trader sells the bag for 30 dollars, making a profit of 8 dollars. This is not enough to reach a total profit of 400 dollars.\n\nLet's try with 2 bags of wheat. The cost of buying and transporting the bags is 44 dollars. The trader sells the bags for 60 dollars, making a profit of 16 dollars. This is still not enough.\n\nLet's try with 3 bags of wheat. The cost of buying and transporting the bags is 66 dollars. The trader sells the bags for 90 dollars, making a profit of 24 dollars. This is getting closer.\n\nLet's try with 4 bags of wheat. The cost of buying and transporting the bags is 88 dollars. The trader sells the bags for 120 dollars, making a profit of 32 dollars. This is enough to reach a total profit of 400 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the trader bought 4 bags of wheat from the farmer and sold all of them to customers.

Let x be the cost of one monitor and y be the cost of the printer. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that Errol bought a computer for $1,100. We also know that he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700. \n\nUsing our variables, we can write two equations: \n\nx + 2y + 1100 = 2400 (the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and printer is $2,400)\ny = 1100 - 400 (the cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer) \n\nSimplifying the second equation: \n\ny = 700 \n\nNow we can substitute y = 700 into the first equation and solve for x: \n\nx + 2(700) + 1100 = 2400 \n\nx + 2500 = 2400 \n\nx = -100 \n\nWait a minute, we got a negative answer for x! This means that something went wrong in our calculations. Let's go back and see if we made a mistake. \n\nLooking at our initial setup, we notice that we made a mistake in our second equation. We wrote y = 1100 - 400, but it should be y = x - 400 (since the cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer, not a fixed amount of $400). \n\nLet's correct that mistake and try again: \n\nx + 2y + 1100 = 2400 \ny = x - 400 \n\nSubstituting y = x - 400 into the first equation: \n\nx + 2(x-400) + 1100 = 2400 \n\n3x - 700 = 2400 \n\n3x = 3100 \n\nx = 1033.33 \n\nSo the answer is: 'the cost of one monitor is $1,033.33'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

We can use the fact that there are 10 cages of hamsters kept alone to set up another equation:\n3r + 10h + 0 = total number of cages\n\nWe don't know the total number of cages, but we do know that there are no other small rodents in the store besides the rats, hamsters, and rabbits. So the total number of cages is just the number of cages for the rats plus the number of cages for the hamsters:\n3 + 10 = 13\n\nNow we have two equations and two variables:\n18r + 5h + 20 = 160\n3r + 10h = 13\n\nWe can solve for h in the second equation:\n10h = 13 - 3r\nh = (13 - 3r) / 10\n\nWe can substitute that expression for h into the first equation:\n18r + 5((13 - 3r) / 10) + 20 = 160\n\nSimplifying that equation:\n18r + (65 - 15r) / 2 + 20 = 160\n36r + 65 - 15r + 40 = 320\n21r = 215\nr = 10.238\n\nWe can't have a fraction of a rat, so we'll round to the nearest whole number:\nr = 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the rats are in each cage are 10.\"\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

This gives us 8 bottles.\n\nNext, we use the formula distance = rate x time to find the time it takes Richard to go from one bottle to the next, where the rate is 1 bottle per 5 seconds (since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next) and the distance is the distance between each bottle (3 feet). We subtract 1 from the number of bottles because Richard only needs to go from bottle to bottle 7 times, since he starts at the first bottle.\n\nFinally, we multiply the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next by the number of times he needs to do it, which gives us the total time it takes Richard to set off all the soda fountains.\n\nOutput:\nThe answer is 35 seconds.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Therefore, he needs to wash 2 x 52 = 104 loads of twin sheets in a year. \n\nFrom the equation 1 = k, we know that he needs to wash 1 load of king sheets every week. Therefore, he needs to wash 1 x 52 = 52 loads of king sheets in a year. \n\nAdding these two numbers together, we get: \n104 + 52 = 156\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 'the answer is 156 loads of laundry'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Let's solve for z in terms of x and y:\n\n20x + 20y + 30z = 2400\nz = (2400 - 20x - 20y) / 30\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n0.25x + y + (2400 - 20x - 20y) / 30 = 0.5(x + 2y + (2400 - 20x - 20y) / 30)\n\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\n\ny = (48 - 2x) / 9\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the first equation and solve for x:\n\n20x + 20((48 - 2x) / 9) + 30((2400 - 20x - 20((48 - 2x) / 9)) / 30) = 2400\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 108\n\nSo Jack used 108 quarters, his two worse friends used 24 quarters each, and his better friend used 36 quarters. Therefore, the total amount spent on quarters is:\n\n0.25(108 + 24 + 24 + 36) = 48.5\n\nThe answer is $48.50.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

We know that she walked for 8 hours, so we can set up the equation:\nd = s * 8\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for s:\ns = d / 8\nSo Sandy's walking speed is d / 8 miles per hour. Now we can use this to calculate the total time Sandy walked on the first day:\nt1 = d / (d/8) = 8 hours\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time Sandy walked on the second day.\nWe know that Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. So the total time she walked on the second day is:\nt2 = 0.5 * t1 = 0.5 * 8 = 4 hours\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes.\nWe know that Sandy walked for a total of t1 + t2 hours. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60:\ntotal_time = (t1 + t2) * 60 = (8 + 4) * 60 = 720 minutes\n\nSo the answer is 'the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is 720 minutes'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

In other words, the number of cookies he can have is:\n\n0.5c + 2 \n\nAnd we know that he wants to eat five cookies in total. So we can set up an equation:\n\n0.5c + 2 = 5 \n\nNow we can solve for c: \n\n0.5c = 3 \n\nc = 6 \n\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat six carrot sticks. \n\nThe answer is \"the answer is 6\".\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}
