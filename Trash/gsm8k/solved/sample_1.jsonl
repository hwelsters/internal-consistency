However, we also know from the third equation that y cannot be greater than 36. So lets try plugging in some values for x between 20 and 72 (which is 2x when x = 36) and see what y values we get:\n\nWhen x = 21, y = 0.5 (not allowed)\nWhen x = 22, y = 1 (not allowed)\nWhen x = 23, y = 1.5 (not allowed)\n...\nWhen x = 35, y = 7 (allowed)\nWhen x = 36, y = 8 (allowed)\nWhen x = 37, y = 8.5 (not allowed)\n...\nWhen x = 71, y = 35.5 (not allowed)\nWhen x = 72, y = 36 (allowed)\n\nSo the only values of x that work are 36 and above.

Therefore, B = 3*8P = 24P.\n- The two remaining friends ate 3\/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate (3\/4)P*12 = 9P slices. Therefore, R = 2*9P = 18P.\n- The total number of slices of pizza eaten is B + R.\n- The total number of slices of pizza ordered is 5P*12 = 60P.\n- The number of slices of pizza left is the difference between the total number of slices ordered and the total number of slices eaten.\nPutting it all together, we get the following algebraic system of equations:\nB = 24P\nR = 18P\nB + R = Total number of slices eaten\nTotal number of slices eaten = 60P - Number of slices of pizza left\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nWe can now solve for the number of slices of pizza left. From the equations above, we have:\nB + R = 24P + 18P = 42P (total number of slices eaten)\nTotal number of slices eaten = 60P - Number of slices of pizza left\nSubstituting, we get:\n42P = 60P - Number of slices of pizza left\nNumber of slices of pizza left = 18P\nSince each pizza has 12 slices, we can convert this to:\nNumber of slices of pizza left = 18P * 12 = 216P\nTherefore, the answer is \"the number of slices of pizza left is 216P\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{a: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0}","flag":"FREE"}

Lets go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in our equation. We said that the number of microphones that fit would be equal to the number of pairs, but we forgot that each pair takes up 2 microphones.

Make the cake batter (20 minutes)\n2. Bake the cake (30 minutes)\n3. Cool the cake (2 hours = 120 minutes)\n4. Frost the cake (10 minutes)\n\nSo the total time needed to make the cake is:\n20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes\n\nNow we need to figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. Lets assume she wants the cake to be ready 10 minutes before 5:00 pm, so at 4:50 pm. \n\nIf Jordan starts making the cake at x minutes before 4:50 pm, the cake will be ready in 180 minutes. So the equation we need to solve is:\n\nx + 180 = 4:50 pm in minutes (which is 290 minutes)\n\nTo solve for x, we need to subtract 180 from both sides:\n\nx = 290 - 180 = 110\n\nSo Jordan needs to start making the cake 110 minutes, or 1 hour and 50 minutes, before 4:50 pm, which is:\n\n5:00 pm - 1 hour and 50 minutes = 3:10 pm\n\nTherefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 3:10 pm. \n\nThe answer is: \"the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 3:10 pm.\"\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"{a: 110}","flag":"OK"}

Therefore, her bids can be expressed as: \n\n200 + (200 + 50) + (200 + 2*50) + ... + (200 + (x-1)*50) \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\n200x + 50(1+2+...+(x-1)) \n\nThe sum in the parentheses is an arithmetic series with first term 1, common difference 1, and x-1 terms. Its sum can be calculated using the formula: \n\nS = (n\/2)(a1 + an) \n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. \n\nApplying this formula to the sum in the parentheses, we get: \n\nS = ((x-1)\/2)(1 + (x-1)) = (x-1)(x\/2) \n\nSubstituting this expression back into the original equation, we get: \n\n200x + 50(x-1)(x\/2) \n\nSimplifying further, we get: \n\n200x + 25x(x-1) \n\nExpanding the second term, we get: \n\n200x + 25x^2 - 25x \n\nCombining like terms, we get: \n\n25x^2 + 175x \n\nNow we set this expression equal to the total amount spent on the desk: \n\n25x^2 + 175x = cost of desk \n\nSince Carmen wins the auction, her total cost must be greater than or equal to the cost of the desk. Therefore, we can set up the inequality: \n\n25x^2 + 175x >= 200 + 50 + 250 + 300 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n25x^2 + 175x >= 800 \n\nDividing both sides by 25, we get: \n\nx^2 + 7x >= 32 \n\nThis is a quadratic inequality, which we can solve by finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation: \n\nx^2 + 7x - 32 = 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nx = (-7 +\/- sqrt(7^2 + 4*32))\/2 \n\nx = (-7 +\/- 9)\/2 \n\nx = 1 or x = -8 \n\nSince x has to be a positive integer (it represents the number of times Carmen bids after the first bid), we choose x = 1 as our solution. \n\nTherefore, the amount of money Carmen spends on the desk is: \n\n200 + (200 + 50) = 450 \n\nThe answer is the desk costs Carmen $450.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{a: 25*c + 175*d, b: 32\/7 - c\/7}","flag":"FREE"}

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.\n2. His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.\n3. How many loads of laundry does he do in a year?\n\nLets define:\nt = number of twin sets of sheets\nk = number of king sets of sheets\n\nFrom step 1, we know that Greg uses 4 twin sets and 1 king set every week. We can write this as:\n\n4t + 1k = weekly total\n\nFrom step 2, we know that Greg can only wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. So the number of loads of laundry he does is equivalent to the number of times he needs to wash the sheets. We can write this as:\n\nnumber of loads = (number of twin sets needed to wash) + (number of king sets needed to wash)\nnumber of loads = (t \/ 2) + (k \/ 1)\n\nFrom step 3, we want to know how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can multiply the weekly total by 52. We can write this as:\n\nnumber of loads in a year = weekly total x 52\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following system of equations:\n\n4t + 1k = weekly total\nnumber of loads = (t \/ 2) + k\nnumber of loads in a year = weekly total x 52\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nWe dont know the exact value of the weekly total, but we can assume that Greg washes all the sheets every week. Therefore, the weekly total is:\n\nweekly total = 4 twin sets + 1 king set\nweekly total = 4(2) + 1(1)\nweekly total = 9\n\nNow we can substitute this value into the second equation to find the number of loads:\n\nnumber of loads = (t \/ 2) + k\nnumber of loads = (4\/2) + 1\nnumber of loads = 3\n\nFinally, we can use the third equation to find the number of loads in a year:\n\nnumber of loads in a year = weekly total x 52\nnumber of loads in a year = 9 x 52\nnumber of loads in a year = 468\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 468\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{c: e\/2 + f, d: 4*e + f, a: b}","flag":"FREE"}

We can write:\n\nbu = 3\nru = (1\/3) * r\n\nTo find out how many shoe boxes Tim has left, we need to subtract the number of boxes used from the original total. We can write:\n\nb_left + r_left = b + r - bu - ru    (equation 2)\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nTo solve for b_left and r_left, we need to substitute the values of bu and ru into equation 2 and simplify:\n\nb_left + r_left = 7 + 9 - 3 - (1\/3) * r\nb_left + r_left = 13 - (1\/3) * r\n\nWe can use equation 1 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Lets solve for r:\n\nr = 16 - b\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\nb_left + r_left = 7 + 9 - 3 - (1\/3) * (16 - b)\nb_left + r_left = 13 - (5\/3) * b\n\nWe have two equations with two variables (equation 1 and the simplified version of equation 2). We can solve for one variable in terms of the other in equation 1, and substitute into the simplified version of equation 2. This gives us one equation with one variable, which we can solve for:\n\nb + r = 16\nr = 16 - b\n\nSubstitute into simplified version of equation 2:\n\nb_left + r_left = 13 - (5\/3) * b\nb_left + (16 - b)_left = 13 - (5\/3) * b\n16 - b_left = 13 - (8\/3) * b\n3 = (8\/3) * b\nb = 9\/4\n\nNow that we know b, we can solve for r using equation 1:\n\nb + r = 16\n(9\/4) + r = 16\nr = 55\/4\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nthe answer is 9\/4 blue shoe boxes and 55\/4 red shoe boxes left in Tims box.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"FREE"}

Kalindas mom adds half as many pieces per minute, so the total number of pieces she adds in M minutes is 2K. Together, they complete the puzzle, which has 360 pieces, so: \n\n4K + 2M = 360 \n\nEquation 2: We want to know how many hours it will take for them to complete the puzzle, so we need to express K and M in terms of hours: \n\nK = (number of minutes it takes Kalinda) \/ 60 \nM = (number of minutes it takes Kalindas mom) \/ 60 \n\nStep 2: \n\nLets solve for K and M in terms of 4K + 2M = 360: \n\n4K + 2M = 360 \n2K + M = 180  (divide both sides by 2) \nM = 180 - 2K \n\nNow lets substitute this expression for M into our equation for K: \n\n4K + 2M = 360 \n4K + 2(180 - 2K) = 360 \n4K + 360 - 4K = 360 \n360 = 360 \n\nThis equation is true, which means there are infinitely many solutions for K and M that satisfy our system of equations. However, we can still find a reasonable answer by making some assumptions. For example, lets assume that Kalindas mom can never add more pieces per minute than Kalinda (otherwise, Kalinda would just let her mom do all the work!). In this case, we can set M = K\/2: \n\n4K + 2M = 360 \n4K + 2(K\/2) = 360 \n6K = 360 \nK = 60 \n\nSo it will take Kalinda 60 minutes to complete the puzzle, or 1 hour. Since Kalindas mom takes half as long, it will take her 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours.
