We also know that Maria's age four years ago was half Ann's age four years ago: \nM - 4 = (1\/2)(A - 4)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve to find the values of M and A. \n\nStep 2: Solve for M and A \n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation: \n\nM - 4 = (1\/2)(A - 4) \n2(M - 4) = A - 4  (multiply both sides by 2) \n2M - 8 = A - 4 \n2M = A + 4  (add 8 to both sides) \n\nNow we can substitute the first equation (M = A - 3) into the simplified second equation: \n\n2M = A + 4 \n2(A - 3) = A + 4  (substitute M = A - 3) \n2A - 6 = A + 4 \nA = 10 \n\nSo Ann is currently 10 years old. We can use the first equation (M = A - 3) to find Maria's age: \n\nM = A - 3 \nM = 10 - 3 \nM = 7 \n\nSo Maria is currently 7 years old. \n\nStep 3: Final Answer \n\nThe answer is: Maria is 7 years old and Ann is 10 years old.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"{a: 10, b: 7}","flag":"OK"}

Then we can create two equations based on the information given:\n\n40L + 35S = 20,000  (equation 1)\n70L + 90S = 40,000  (equation 2)\n\nTo solve for L and S, we can use the method of elimination. First, we'll multiply equation 1 by 2 to get rid of the variable \"S\":\n\n80L + 70S = 40,000  (equation 3)\n\nThen we can subtract equation 3 from equation 2 to eliminate \"L\":\n\n20L + 20S = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nL + S = 0\n\nSo we can see that L = -S. This means that the larger shovel and the smaller shovel move earth at equal rates, but in opposite directions (i.e. one is digging while the other is filling in). To find their individual rates, we can substitute L = -S into either equation 1 or 2:\n\n40(-S) + 35S = 20,000\n-5S = -10,000\nS = 2,000\n\nSo the smaller shovel can move 2,000 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone. To find the rate of the larger shovel, we can use L = -S:\n\nL = -2,000\n\nSo the larger shovel can move 2,000 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the smaller shovel can move 2,000 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone, and the larger shovel can move 2,000 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone as well.\"\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"FREE"}

Now we can use either of the two equations we derived earlier to solve for the speed of the current. Let's use:\n\n48 = b + c\n\nSubstituting in the value we just found for \"b\", we get:\n\n48 = 40 + c\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get:\n\n8 = c\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 8 miles per hour.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe answer is the speed of the current is 8 miles per hour.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[{a: 1, b: 40, c: 8}]","flag":"FREE"}
