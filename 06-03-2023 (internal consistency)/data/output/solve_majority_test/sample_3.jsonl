We also know that Mary was 5 times as old as her son, so we can write the equation: \n\nM-5 = 5(S-5) \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that 3 years from now, Mary's age will be M+3 and her son's age will be S+3. We also know that Mary's age will be 8 less than three times her son's age, so we can write the equation: \n\nM+3 = 3(S+3) - 8 \n\nStep 2: \nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for M and S. \n\nExpanding the second equation, we get: \n\nM+3 = 3S + 7 \n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get: \n\nM = 3S + 4 \n\nSubstituting this expression for M into the first equation, we get: \n\n3S + 4 - 5 = 5(S-5) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n3S - 1 = 5S - 25 \n\nSubtracting 3S from both sides, we get: \n\n-1 = 2S - 25 \n\nAdding 25 to both sides, we get: \n\n24 = 2S \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\nS = 12 \n\nNow we can substitute this value of S back into one of our earlier equations to solve for M. Using the equation M = 3S + 4, we get: \n\nM = 3(12) + 4 = 40 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\nthe answer is Mary is 40 years old and her son is 12 years old."}

The distance covered is 372 meters, the time is 4 minutes, and the child's speed is c + s (since they are running with the sidewalk's motion). So we get the equation: \n\n372 = (c + s) x 4 \n\nFor the second scenario (running against the sidewalk), we use the same formula. The distance covered is 165 meters, the time is 3 minutes, and the child's speed is c - s (since they are running against the sidewalk's motion). So we get the equation: \n\n165 = (c - s) x 3 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, so we can solve for c and s. \n\nFirst, let's solve for c by eliminating s.
