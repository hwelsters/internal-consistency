Then, according to the problem, the rate of the faster car is \"r + 24\" (in km\/h).\n\nWe know that the two cars are traveling in opposite directions, so their distances are adding up to the total distance of 702 km. We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate * time\n\nFor the slower car, the distance it travels in 6 hours is:\n\ndistance = r * 6 = 6r\n\nFor the faster car, the distance it travels in 6 hours is:\n\ndistance = (r + 24) * 6 = 6(r + 24)\n\nAdding these distances together gives the total distance of 702 km:\n\n6r + 6(r + 24) = 702\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n6r + 6r + 144 = 702\n\n12r = 558\n\nr = 46.5\n\nSo the slower car is traveling at 46.5 km\/h, and the faster car is traveling at 70.5 km\/h (since its rate is 24 km\/h faster). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the rates of the slower and faster car are 46.5 km\/h and 70.5 km\/h, respectively.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

First, let's solve for c by isolating it in one of the equations:\n\nc = (10b - 300) \/ 10\nc = b - 35\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for c into the other equation:\n\n350 = (b + b - 35) x 7\n350 = (2b - 35) x 7\n50 = 2b - 35\n85 = 2b\nb = 42.5\n\nFinally, we can use either equation to solve for c:\n\nc = b - 35\nc = 42.5 - 35\nc = 7.5\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nthe speed of the boat is 42.5 feet per minute and the speed of the current is 7.5 feet per minute.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The boat makes a trip upstream to a certain point in 20 minutes ; the return trip takes 15 minutes . What is the speed of the current ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the speed of the current as c (in miles per hour). \n\nWhen the boat is going upstream (against the current), its effective speed is decreased by the speed of the current. So the boat's speed relative to the shore is 16 - c. \n\nWhen the boat is going downstream (with the current), its effective speed is increased by the speed of the current. So the boat's speed relative to the shore is 16 + c. \n\nLet d be the distance traveled by the boat in one direction (upstream or downstream doesn't matter, since the distance is the same). \n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the boat takes 20 minutes (1\/3 of an hour) to travel this distance upstream, and 15 minutes (1\/4 of an hour) to travel it downstream. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can write two equations: \n\nd = (16 - c) x (1\/3)    (when going upstream) \n\nd = (16 + c) x (1\/4)    (when going downstream) \n\nSimplifying each equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator: \n\nd = (16 - c)\/3 \n\nd = (16 + c)\/4 \n\nSince both equations are equal to d, we can set them equal to each other: \n\n(16 - c)\/3 = (16 + c)\/4 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominators: \n\n4(16 - c) = 3(16 + c) \n\nSimplifying: \n\n64 - 4c = 48 + 3c \n\n7c = 16 \n\nc = 16\/7 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 16\/7 miles per hour. \n\nThe answer is 'the speed of the current is 16\/7 miles per hour.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

One train travels at 60 mph and the other at 80 mph . In how many hours will they be 910 miles apart ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic system of equations\n\nLet's define the distance covered by the first train as x and the distance covered by the second train as y. We know that the two trains are moving in opposite directions, so their distances will add up to the total distance between them, which is 910 miles.\n\nx + y = 910\n\nWe also know that the speed of the first train is 60 mph and the speed of the second train is 80 mph. We can use the formula:\n\nspeed = distance\/time\n\nto express the time it takes for each train to cover its distance:\n\ntime taken by first train = x\/60\n\ntime taken by second train = y\/80\n\nSince the two trains leave at the same time, the time taken by both trains should be the same. Therefore:\n\nx\/60 = y\/80\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve simultaneously to find the values of x and y.\n\nStep 2: Solving the equations\n\nLet's rearrange the second equation to express y in terms of x:\n\ny = (80\/60) x\n\ny = (4\/3) x\n\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\nx + (4\/3) x = 910\n\n(7\/3) x = 910\n\nx = (3\/7) * 910\n\nx = 390\n\nNow that we know x, we can use the second equation to find y:\n\ny = (4\/3) x\n\ny = (4\/3) * 390\n\ny = 520\n\nThe two trains will be 910 miles apart when one train has covered 390 miles and the other has covered 520 miles.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance\/speed\n\nto find the time taken by each train. The time taken by the first train is:\n\ntime taken by first train = 390\/60\n\ntime taken by first train = 6.5 hours\n\nThe time taken by the second train is:\n\ntime taken by second train = 520\/80\n\ntime taken by second train = 6.5 hours\n\nSince both trains took the same amount of time to cover their distances, the total time taken for them to be 910 miles apart is:\n\ntotal time = 6.5 hours\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nthe answer is 6.5 hours.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Let's solve for b:\n\nDivide both sides of the first equation by 3:\n\n20 = b + s\n\nNow we can use this equation to substitute for b in the second equation:\n\n60 = (20 - s) x 12\n\nSimplify:\n\n60 = 240 - 12s\n\nSubtract 240 from both sides:\n\n-180 = -12s\n\nDivide by -12:\n\n15 = s\n\nSo the speed of the stream is 15 miles per hour.\n\nThe answer is \"the speed of the stream is 15 miles per hour.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

We can set up two equations based on the information given:\n\nx + y = 1800  (the total distance is 1800 m)\nx\/70 + y\/210 \u2264 20\/60  (it took him 20 minutes or less to get to school)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 210:\n\n3x + y \u2264 420\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nx + y = 1800  -->  x = 1800 - y\n3x + y \u2264 420\n\nSubstitute x into the second equation:\n\n3(1800 - y) + y \u2264 420\n5400 - 2y \u2264 420\n-2y \u2264 -4980\ny = 2490\n\nSo Tom ran at least 2490 m. To find out how far he walked, we can substitute y back into the first equation:\n\nx + 2490 = 1800\nx = -690\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since x represents a distance and it can't be negative. So we made an error somewhere. Let's check our work:\n\nIf Tom runs the entire distance, he will take 1800\/210 = 8.57 minutes, which is less than 20 minutes. So it's possible that Tom ran the entire distance and didn't walk at all. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation:\n\n3(0) + 1800 \u2264 420\n\nThis is clearly not true, so Tom must have walked some distance.

Substituting b into the first equation:\n\na + 2490 = 1800\na = -690\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense. What's going on here? Let's think about the problem:\n\nTom walked part of the way and then ran the rest. We assumed that he walked a certain distance and ran the remaining distance, but what if he did it the other way around? Let's try assuming that he ran a distance of \"c\" and then walked the remaining distance:\n\nc + d = 1800\nc\/210 + d\/70 \u2264 20\/60\n\nSimplifying the second equation:\n\nc\/210 + d\/210 \u2264 1\/3\nc + d \u2264 700\n\nUsing substitution:\n\nc + d = 1800  -->  d = 1800 - c\nc\/210 + d\/70 \u2264 20\/60\n\nSubstituting d into the second equation:\n\nc\/210 + (1800 - c)\/70 \u2264 1\/3\n3c + 5400 - 9c \u2264 2100\n-6c \u2264 -3300\nc = 550\n\nTom ran at least 550 m.

If the company paid $ 217,500 for the trees , how many of each kind did the company buy ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's use the following variables:\n- Let x be the number of Douglas fir trees.\n- Let y be the number of ponderosa pine trees.\n\nUsing these variables, we can write two equations based on the given information:\n- x + y = 850 (equation 1, representing the total number of trees)\n- 300x + 225y = 217500 (equation 2, representing the total amount paid)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use any method of solving systems of equations, such as substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination:\n\n- Multiply equation 1 by 225: 225x + 225y = 191250\n- Subtract this from equation 2: (300x + 225y) - (225x + 225y) = 75000\n- Simplify: 75x = 75000\n- Solve for x: x = 1000\n- Substitute x = 1000 into equation 1: 1000 + y = 850\n- Solve for y: y = -150\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't have negative trees. So we made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet's check our equations and see where we went wrong. Looking at equation 2, we can see that we made a mistake in converting the total amount paid into an equation:\n- The company paid $300 for each Douglas fir, so the total cost of x Douglas fir trees is 300x.\n- The company paid $225 for each ponderosa pine, so the total cost of y ponderosa pine trees is 225y.\n- The total amount paid is the sum of these: 300x + 225y.\n\nSo we need to fix equation 2 to reflect this:\n\n- 300x + 225y = 217500\n\nNow we can continue with elimination:\n\n- Multiply equation 1 by 225: 225x + 225y = 191250\n- Subtract this from equation 2: (300x + 225y) - (225x + 225y) = 75000\n- Simplify: 75x = 75000\n- Solve for x: x = 1000\n- Substitute x = 1000 into equation 1: 1000 + y = 850\n- Solve for y: y = -150\n\nOops, we made the same mistake again! We forgot to fix the coefficients in equation 1 to match equation 2. Let's fix that:\n\n- 300x + 225y = 217500\n- Divide equation 1 by 225: x\/3 + y\/3 = 850\/3\n\nNow we can continue with elimination:\n\n- Multiply equation 1 by 3: x + y = 2550\n- Subtract this from equation 2: (300x + 225y) - 3(x + y) = 0\n- Simplify: 75x = 76500\n- Solve for x: x = 1020\n- Substitute x = 1020 into equation 1: 1020 + y = 850\n- Solve for y: y = -170\n\nOops, we did it again! Let's check our equations one more time. Ah, we made another mistake in equation 1. We need to multiply both sides by 3, not just the left side:\n\n- 300x + 225y = 217500\n- Multiply equation 1 by 3: 3x + 3y = 2550\n\nNow we can continue with elimination:\n\n- Multiply equation 1 by 3: 3x + 3y = 2550\n- Subtract this from equation 2: (300x + 225y) - (3x + 3y) = 0\n- Simplify: 297x = 214950\n- Solve for x: x = 725\n- Substitute x = 725 into equation 1: 725 + y = 850\n- Solve for y: y = 125\n\nFinally, we have our answer:\n\nThe company bought 725 Douglas fir trees and 125 ponderosa pine trees. The answer is \"The company bought 725 Douglas fir trees and 125 ponderosa pine trees.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

How much did he invest in each method -LRB- savings bank and bond -RRB- if his annual income from the two investments was $ 660 ?\n\n\n","response":"Let x be the amount invested in the bank at 5% interest and y be the amount invested in bonds at 9% interest. \n\nWe know that the total amount invested is $10,000, so:\n\nx + y = 10,000 \n\nWe also know that the annual income from the two investments is $660. The interest earned from the bank account can be calculated as 0.05x and the interest earned from the bond can be calculated as 0.09y. Therefore:\n\n0.05x + 0.09y = 660 \n\nNow we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Solving for x in the first equation, we get:\n\nx = 10,000 - y \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n0.05(10,000 - y) + 0.09y = 660 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n500 - 0.05y + 0.09y = 660 \n\n0.04y = 160 \n\ny = 4,000 \n\nSo Little Johnny invested $4,000 in bonds at 9% interest.
