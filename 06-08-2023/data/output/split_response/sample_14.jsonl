This can be represented as 0.125x + 0.25x + $25 = x.\n\nPutting these equations together, we get:\n0.125x + 0.25x + $25 = x\n\nStep 2: Solve for x\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms:\n0.375x + $25 = x\n\nNext, let's isolate the variable on one side of the equation by subtracting 0.375x from both sides:\n$25 = 0.625x\n\nFinally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.625:\nx = $40\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the amount of money Sally had before buying the comic books and videos is $40.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

What is the rate of the plane in still air , and what is the rate of the wind ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by using the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nLet's define the rate of the plane in still air as \"p\" and the rate of the wind as \"w\". \n\nAgainst the wind: \n\ndistance = 3600 km \ntime = 5 hours \nrate = p - w \n\nSo we can write: \n3600 = (p - w) x 5 \n\nWith the wind: \n\ndistance = 3600 km \ntime = 4 hours \nrate = p + w \n\nSo we can write: \n3600 = (p + w) x 4 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using algebra. \n\nFirst, let's solve for p in the first equation: \n\n3600 = (p - w) x 5 \n720 = p - w \np = w + 720\/5 \np = w + 144 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for p into the second equation: \n\n3600 = (p + w) x 4 \n3600 = (w + 144 + w) x 4 \n900 = 2w + 144 \n2w = 756 \nw = 378 \n\nSo the rate of the wind is 378 km\/h. \n\nNow we can use the expression we found for p to find the rate of the plane in still air: \n\np = w + 144 \np = 378 + 144 \np = 522 \n\nSo the rate of the plane in still air is 522 km\/h. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the rate of the plane in still air is 522 km\/h, and the rate of the wind is 378 km\/h.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

How many boxes of each color must be used to make 10 boxes of beads costing $ 1.72 per box ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic System of Equations\n\nLet's use x to represent the number of boxes of red beads and y to represent the number of boxes of yellow beads needed to make 10 boxes of beads.\n\nThe cost of 1 box of red beads is $1.30, so the cost of x boxes of red beads is 1.3x.\nThe cost of 1 box of yellow beads is $2.00, so the cost of y boxes of yellow beads is 2y.\n\nThe total cost of 10 boxes of beads costing $1.72 per box is 10 x $1.72 = $17.20.\n\nTherefore, we can create the following system of equations:\n\n1.3x + 2y = 17.2 (total cost equation)\nx + y = 10 (total quantity equation)\n\nStep 2: Solve for x and y\n\nWe can solve the system of equations above using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nMultiply the second equation by -1:\n-1(x + y = 10) => -x - y = -10\n\nAdd the resulting equation to the first equation:\n1.3x + 2y - x - y = 17.2 - 10\n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n0.3x = 7.2\nx = 24\n\nSubstitute x = 24 into the second equation and solve for y:\n24 + y = 10\ny = -14\n\nSince y represents the number of boxes of yellow beads, which cannot be negative, this solution doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's check our work:\n\nIf we use 24 boxes of red beads, the total cost would be 1.3 x 24 = $31.20.\nIf we use 10 boxes of beads in total, at a cost of $1.72 per box, the total cost would be 10 x 1.72 = $17.20.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to use 24 boxes of red beads and 10 boxes of yellow beads to make 10 boxes of beads costing $1.72 per box.\n\nWe can try a different approach to solve the problem:\n\nLet's use x to represent the number of boxes of red beads and y to represent the total number of boxes of beads (both red and yellow) needed to make 10 boxes of beads.\n\nThe cost of 1 box of red beads is $1.30, so the cost of x boxes of red beads is 1.3x.\nThe cost of 1 box of yellow beads is $2.00, so the cost of (y - x) boxes of yellow beads is 2(y - x) = 2y - 2x.\n\nThe total cost of 10 boxes of beads costing $1.72 per box is 10 x $1.72 = $17.20.\n\nTherefore, we can create the following system of equations:\n\n1.3x + 2(y - x) = 17.2 (total cost equation)\ny = 10 (total quantity equation)\n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n1.3x + 2y - 2x = 17.2\n0.3x = 0.2\nx = 0.67\n\nSince x represents the number of boxes of red beads, which must be a whole number, we need to round up to 1.\n\nSubstitute x = 1 into the second equation and solve for y:\ny = 10\n\nTherefore, we need 1 box of red beads and 9 boxes of yellow beads to make 10 boxes of beads costing $1.72 per box.\n\nStep 3: Output the final answer\n\nThe answer is: we need 1 box of red beads and 9 boxes of yellow beads to make 10 boxes of beads costing $1.72 per box.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Distance traveled by Bill = B * 0.5 (since he traveled for 0.5 hours)\n2. Distance traveled by Chris = C * 0.5 (since he traveled for 0.5 hours)\n\nWe also know that they were 14 miles apart after 0.5 hours. Since they were traveling in opposite directions, we can add their distances to get the total distance between them:\nDistance between them = Distance traveled by Bill + Distance traveled by Chris\nDistance between them = B * 0.5 + C * 0.5\nDistance between them = 0.5(B + C)  (this will be useful later)\n\nFinally, we know that Bill's speed was 2 miles per hour faster than Chris's speed:\nB = C + 2\n\nStep 2: Solve for B and C\nWe can use substitution to solve for B and C.

The boat makes a trip upstream to a certain point in 20 minutes . The return trip takes 15 minutes . What is the speed of the current ?\n\n\n","response":"Let the speed of the current be represented by 'c'.\n\nSince the boat is traveling upstream on the first trip, its speed relative to the ground is 16 - c. On the second trip, the boat is traveling downstream, so its speed relative to the ground is 16 + c.\n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up the following equations:\n\ndistance upstream = (16 - c) * (20\/60) = (4\/3)(16 - c)\ndistance downstream = (16 + c) * (15\/60) = (1\/4)(16 + c)\n\nThe distance traveled upstream and downstream is the same, so we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n(4\/3)(16 - c) = (1\/4)(16 + c)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, we get:\n\n16 - c = 3(16 + c)\/4\n\nSimplifying and solving for c, we get:\n\nc = 4 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the speed of the current is 4 miles per hour'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Five years ago, Sam was four times as old as John: \n\nSam's age 5 years ago = s - 5 \nJohn's age 5 years ago = j - 5 \n\ns - 5 = 4(j - 5) \n\n2. In five years, Sam will be twice as old as John: \n\nSam's age in 5 years = s + 5 \nJohn's age in 5 years = j + 5 \n\ns + 5 = 2(j + 5) \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (s and j). We can solve for one variable in one equation, and substitute it into the other equation to solve for the other variable. \n\nFrom equation 1: \n\ns - 5 = 4(j - 5) \n\ns = 4j - 15 \n\nSubstitute into equation 2: \n\ns + 5 = 2(j + 5) \n\n(4j - 15) + 5 = 2j + 10 \n\n4j - 10 = 2j + 10 \n\n2j = 20 \n\nj = 10 \n\nNow we know that John is currently 10 years old.

Let Alex's current age be A and his father's current age be F. \n\nFrom the first sentence of the problem, we know that: \n\nF = 2A + 5 \n\nFrom the second sentence of the problem, we know that six years ago, their ages were: \n\nA - 6 and F - 6 \n\nAnd we also know that: \n\nF - 6 = (1\/3)(A - 6) \n\nNow we can use algebra to solve for A and F. \n\nFirst, we'll use the third equation to solve for F in terms of A: \n\nF - 6 = (1\/3)(A - 6) \n\nMultiplying both sides by 3: \n\n3F - 18 = A - 6 \n\nAdding 6 to both sides: \n\n3F - 12 = A \n\nNext, we'll substitute this expression for A into the first equation: \n\nF = 2A + 5 \n\nF = 2(3F - 12) + 5 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nF = 6F - 24 + 5 \n\nF = 6F - 19 \n\nSubtracting 6F from both sides: \n\n-5F = -19 \n\nDividing by -5: \n\nF = 3.8 \n\nNow that we know F, we can use either of the first two equations to solve for A.

But if A is negative, then 2A + 5 will also be negative, which doesn't make sense for an age. So we made a mistake somewhere. \n\nGoing back to our work, we see that when we solved for F in terms of A, we got: \n\n3F - 12 = A \n\nBut we made a mistake in this step. It should actually be: \n\n3A - 12 = F \n\n(We accidentally switched the variables.) \n\nNow we can use this correct equation to solve for F: \n\n3A - 12 = F \n\nF = 3A - 12 \n\nSubstituting this expression into the first equation: \n\n3A - 12 = 2A + 5 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nA = 17 \n\nNow we can use either of the first two equations to solve for F.

Let's solve for c first: \n\nc = (d\/t2 - d\/t1) \/ 2 \n\nNext, we can solve for t1 or t2 using the equation t1 + t2 = 4: \n\nt1 = 4 - t2 \n\nPlugging in the expressions for c and t1 into the first equation above, we get: \n\nd = (20 - (d\/t2 + d\/(4-t2))\/2) * t1 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get a quadratic equation: \n\n5d\/t2 + 5d\/(4-t2) - 80 = 0 \n\nSolving for t2 using the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nt2 = (4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 - 4*5*(-80)\/(d\u00b2))) \/ 10 \n\nSince t2 must be between 0 and 4, we take the positive root and simplify: \n\nt2 = (2\/d) * (2*sqrt(d\u00b2 + 400) - d) \n\nFinally, we can plug in t2 into the equation for d: \n\nd = (20 - c) * t1 = (20 - (d\/t2 + d\/(4-t2))\/2) * (4-t2) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get another quadratic equation: \n\nd\u00b2 - 80d + 200t2\u00b2 = 0 \n\nSolving for d using the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nd = 40 \u00b1 sqrt(400 - 5t2\u00b2) \n\nSince d must be positive, we take the positive root and simplify: \n\nd = 40 + sqrt(400 - 5(2*sqrt(d\u00b2 + 400) - d)\u00b2) \n\nAfter simplifying and solving for d, the answer is: \n\nthe answer is approximately 48.5 miles.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

He sold the first one for a 35 % profit and the second for a 15 % profit . He made a total profit of 2,640 by selling these cars.The price that Michael paid for the first car was 2,600 less than the price for the second car . What was the selling price of each car .\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Let x be the price of the second car. Then the price of the first car is (x-2600). \n\nThe profit made on the first car is 35% of the selling price, and the profit made on the second car is 15% of the selling price. \n\nSo, the profit made on the first car is 0.35(selling price of first car) and the profit made on the second car is 0.15(selling price of second car). \n\nWe know that the total profit made is $2,640. So we can set up the following equation: \n\n0.35(selling price of first car) + 0.15(selling price of second car) = 2640 \n\nWe also know that the selling price of each car is the sum of the price Michael paid for it and the profit he made. So we can set up the following equations: \n\nselling price of first car = (x-2600) + 0.35(x-2600) \n\nselling price of second car = x + 0.15x \n\nStep 2: \n\nsimplifying the equations: \n\nselling price of first car = 0.35x + 0.65(2600) \n\nselling price of second car = 1.15x \n\nSubstitute these into the first equation: \n\n0.35(0.35x + 0.65(2600)) + 0.15(1.15x) = 2640 \n\nSolving for x: \n\n0.1225x + 227.5 + 0.15(1.15x) = 2640 \n\n0.4975x = 2412.5 \n\nx = 4850 \n\nSo the selling price of the second car is $5,587.50 \n\nThe selling price of the first car can be found by substituting x = 4850 into the equation we found earlier: \n\nselling price of first car = 0.35(4850-2600) + 0.65(2600) = $4,012.50 \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the selling price of the first car is $4,012.50 and the selling price of the second car is $5,587.50\".","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Checking our work, we see that we made an error when we multiplied the second equation by 100. Instead of 5700, it should be 285. Let's redo the calculations: \n\n675x + 500y = 28500 \n\n500x + 500y = 25000 \n\n175x = 3500 \n\nx = 20 \n\nNow we can find y: \n\nx + y = 50 \n\n20 + y = 50 \n\ny = 30 \n\nSo the answer is: \n\nthe answer is 20 pounds of cashews and 30 pounds of Brazil nuts.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The amount of alcohol in x liters of 40% solution is 0.4x, and the amount of alcohol in y liters of 70% solution is 0.7y. The total amount of alcohol in the final solution is 0.49 times 80, or 39.2 liters. So we have:\n0.4x + 0.7y = 39.2\n\nStep 2:\nWe have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for x and y. \nFirst, we can rearrange the first equation to get:\ny = 80 - x\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n0.4x + 0.7(80-x) = 39.2\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n0.4x + 56 - 0.7x = 39.2\n-0.3x = -16.8\nx = 56\n\nSo we need 56 liters of the 40% alcohol solution.

However, we can see that our equations are consistent with the fact that we cannot have negative cups of coffee, so we can conclude that there are no 10 oz. cups and that Kyle filled 21 14 oz. cups and 3 20 oz. cups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Kyle filled 21 14 oz. cups and 3 20 oz. cups.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
