How much does he owe on each loan ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: \n\nLet's use x to represent the amount owed on the 9% loan. \n\nThen, since Hollis owes $1500 more on the 7% loan, the amount owed on the 7% loan can be represented as (x + 1500). \n\nWe know that the total interest paid last year was $617. \n\nThe interest paid on the 9% loan can be represented as 0.09x. \n\nThe interest paid on the 7% loan can be represented as 0.07(x + 1500). \n\nPutting it all together, we get the following system of equations: \n\n0.09x + 0.07(x + 1500) = 617 \n\nx + 1500 = amount owed on the 7% loan \n\nStep 2: \n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can start by simplifying the first equation: \n\n0.09x + 0.07x + 105 = 617 \n\n0.16x = 512 \n\nx = 3200 \n\nSo the amount owed on the 9% loan is $3200. \n\nTo find the amount owed on the 7% loan, we can use the second equation: \n\namount owed on the 7% loan = x + 1500 = 4700 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\nthe amount owed on the 9% loan is $3200, and the amount owed on the 7% loan is $4700.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

One runs at an average rate which is 24 kilometers per hour faster than the other . Find their rates if after 6 hours , they are 702 km apart .\n\n\n","response":"Let's call the rate of the slower car \"r\" (in kilometers per hour). Then, the rate of the faster car is \"r + 24\" (in kilometers per hour).\n\nWe know that the two cars are traveling in opposite directions, so their distances are adding up to the total distance of 702 kilometers. After 6 hours, the distance traveled by the slower car is 6r, and the distance traveled by the faster car is 6(r + 24). So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n6r + 6(r + 24) = 702\n\nSimplifying and solving for r, we get:\n\n12r + 144 = 702\n12r = 558\nr = 46.5\n\nSo, the rate of the slower car is 46.5 kilometers per hour. To find the rate of the faster car, we can plug in r to the expression we used earlier:\n\nr + 24 = 46.5 + 24 = 70.5\n\nTherefore, the rate of the faster car is 70.5 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe answer is: the rate of the slower car is 46.5 kilometers per hour and the rate of the faster car is 70.5 kilometers per hour.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Find the present ages of Lewis and Brown .\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by setting up an algebraic system of equations:\nLet Lewis's present age be L and Brown's present age be B.\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\nL\/B = 1\/2 (Equation 1)\nAnd in 3 years:\n(L+3)\/(B+3) = 3\/5 (Equation 2)\n\nTo solve for L and B, we can use substitution. From Equation 1, we can rearrange it to L = B\/2. Then substitute L into Equation 2:\n\n((B\/2) + 3)\/(B+3) = 3\/5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5(B+3) gives:\n\n5(B\/2 + 3) = 3(B+3)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n5B\/2 + 15 = 3B + 9\n\n2B = -6\n\nB = -3\n\nThis doesn't make sense, as we can't have negative ages. We made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet's try another method. We can use ratios to set up a proportion. From the problem statement, we know that the ratio of Lewis's age to Brown's age is 1:2. This means that Lewis's age is 1\/3 of the total age and Brown's age is 2\/3 of the total age. Let T be the total age.\n\nSo, Lewis's age is (1\/3)T and Brown's age is (2\/3)T.\n\nIn 3 years, their ages will increase by 3, so we have:\n\n((1\/3)T + 3)\/((2\/3)T + 3) = 3\/5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 15(2T+9) gives:\n\n5T + 45 = 9T + 27\n\n4T = 18\n\nT = 4.5\n\nSo Lewis's age is (1\/3)(4.5) = 1.5 and Brown's age is (2\/3)(4.5) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the present ages of Lewis and Brown are 1.5 years and 3 years, respectively.\n\nThe answer is \"the present ages of Lewis and Brown are 1.5 years and 3 years, respectively.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The return trip takes four hours with the wind . What is the rate of the plane in still air , and what is the rate of the wind ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's use the following variables:\n- Let p be the speed of the plane in still air (in km\/h)\n- Let w be the speed of the wind (in km\/h)\n\nWe know that:\n- Against the wind, the plane's effective speed is reduced, so its speed is p - w.\n- With the wind, the plane's effective speed is increased, so its speed is p + w.\n\nUsing the formula distance = speed x time, we can create the following system of equations:\n\n(p - w) x 5 = 3600\n(p + w) x 4 = 3600\n\nNow we can solve for p and w. First, let's simplify the equations:\n\n5p - 5w = 3600\n4p + 4w = 3600\n\nNext, we can use either substitution or elimination to solve for p and w. Let's use elimination by multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 5, so that we can eliminate w:\n\n20p - 20w = 14400\n20p + 20w = 18000\n\nAdding the two equations together gives:\n\n40p = 32400\n\nDividing both sides by 40:\n\np = 810\n\nNow we can substitute p back into either of the original equations to solve for w. Let's use the first equation:\n\n5(810) - 5w = 3600\n\nSimplifying:\n\n4050 - 5w = 3600\n\nSubtracting 4050 from both sides:\n\n-5w = -450\n\nDividing both sides by -5:\n\nw = 90\n\nTherefore, the speed of the plane in still air is 810 km\/h, and the speed of the wind is 90 km\/h.\n\nThe answer is: the speed of the plane in still air is 810 km\/h, and the speed of the wind is 90 km\/h.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

What is this stream 's km per hour ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's call the speed of the ship in still water \"s\" and the speed of the stream \"c\". \n\nWhen the ship is going upstream, it is going against the current, so its effective speed is s - c. When it is going downstream, it is going with the current, so its effective speed is s + c. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up two equations: \n\n36 = (s - c) x 3 \n\n36 = (s + c) x 2 \n\nNow we can solve for s and c. \n\nFirst, let's solve for s: \n\n36\/3 = s - c \n\n12 = s - c \n\ns = 12 + c \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation: \n\n36 = (12 + c + c) x 2 \n\n36 = (12 + 2c) x 2 \n\n18 = 12 + 2c \n\n6 = c \n\nSo the speed of the stream is 6 km\/h. \n\nTo find the speed of the ship, we can substitute this value of c back into one of our equations for s: \n\n36\/3 = s - 6 \n\n12 = s - 6 \n\ns = 18 \n\nSo the speed of the ship is 18 km\/h. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the ship's speed is 18 km\/h and the stream's speed is 6 km\/h'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Let the time spent flying east be t hours. Then the time spent flying west is (7-t) hours. \n\nFrom the given information, we can write two equations: \n\nx = 300t  (distance = rate x time, where rate is 300 km\/h when flying east)\nx = 400(7-t)  (distance = rate x time, where rate is 400 km\/h when flying west)\n\nSimplifying the second equation: \n\nx = 400(7-t)\nx = 2800 - 400t\n\nSince both equations equal x, we can set them equal to each other: \n\n300t = 2800 - 400t\n\nSolving for t: \n\n700t = 2800\nt = 4\n\nNow we can use either equation to find x: \n\nx = 300t = 300(4) = 1200\n\nTherefore, the plane flew 1200 km from the airport. \n\nThe answer is 'the plane flew 1200 km from the airport'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

If they leave at the same time and walk in the same direction , Rizza overtakes Angels in 60 hours . If they walk towards each other , they meet in 5 hours . What are their speeds ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the speed of Rizza as r and the speed of Angel as a.\n\nStep 1: Algebraic system of equations\n\nFrom the first scenario, we know that Rizza overtakes Angel in 60 hours. This means that Rizza walks for 60 hours more than Angel. The distance they cover during this time is the same and is equal to the distance they were apart at the beginning, which is 30 km. Therefore, we can write:\n\n60r = 60a + 30   (equation 1)\n\nFrom the second scenario, we know that they meet in 5 hours while walking towards each other. The sum of the distances they cover is equal to the distance they were apart at the beginning, which is 30 km. Therefore, we can write:\n\n5r + 5a = 30   (equation 2)\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using any method of our choice.\n\nStep 2: Solution\n\nFrom equation 1, we can simplify and write:\n\nr = a + 0.5   (equation 3)\n\nSubstituting equation 3 into equation 2, we get:\n\n5(a + 0.5) + 5a = 30\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n10a + 2.5 = 30\n\n10a = 27.5\n\na = 2.75\n\nSubstituting this value of a into equation 3, we get:\n\nr = 2.75 + 0.5 = 3.25\n\nTherefore, the speed of Angel is 2.75 km\/h and the speed of Rizza is 3.25 km\/h.\n\nThe answer is \"the speed of Angel is 2.75 km\/h and the speed of Rizza is 3.25 km\/h.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

If the cars are driven toward each other , they will meet in 48 minutes . However , if they are driven in the same direction , they will meet in 240 minutes . What is the rate at which each car is driven ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's call the rate of the first car \"r1\" and the rate of the second car \"r2\". \n\nStep 1: \nWe can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. \n\nWhen the cars are driving towards each other, they cover a distance of 140 km in 48 minutes. \n\ndistance = 140 km \ntime = 48\/60 hours (convert minutes to hours) = 0.8 hours \nrate of first car = r1 \nrate of second car = r2 \n\nUsing the formula, we get two equations: \n140 = r1 * 0.8 + r2 * 0.8    (equation 1) \n\nWhen the cars are driving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds. So, they cover a distance of 140 km in 240 minutes. \n\ndistance = 140 km \ntime = 240\/60 hours = 4 hours \nrelative speed = r1 - r2 \n\nUsing the formula, we get another equation: \n140 = (r1 - r2) * 4     (equation 2) \n\nStep 2: \nLet's simplify equation 1: \n140 = 0.8r1 + 0.8r2 \nDivide both sides by 0.8: \n175 = r1 + r2 \n\nNow, let's simplify equation 2: \n140 = 4r1 - 4r2 \nDivide both sides by 4: \n35 = r1 - r2 \n\nWe have two equations: \n\n175 = r1 + r2 \n35 = r1 - r2 \n\nWe can solve for r1 and r2 by adding these two equations: \n\n175 + 35 = 2r1 \nr1 = 100 km\/h \n\nNow, we can substitute r1 into one of the equations to find r2: \n\n35 = 100 - r2 \nr2 = 65 km\/h \n\nThe answer is: \nthe rate of the first car is 100 km\/h and the rate of the second car is 65 km\/h.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

So we can set up the following equation:\n\n300 = (b - c) * 5\n\nWhen the boat is going downstream (with the current), its effective speed is increased by the speed of the current. So we can set up the following equation:\n\n300 = (b + c) * 2\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using algebra. First, let's solve the first equation for b:\n\n300 = (b - c) * 5\n60 = b - c\nb = 60 + c\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for b into the second equation:\n\n300 = (b + c) * 2\n300 = (60 + 2c + c) * 2\n300 = (62 + 3c) * 2\n300 = 124 + 6c\n6c = 176\nc = 29.33\n\nSo the rate of the current is 29.33 mph.
