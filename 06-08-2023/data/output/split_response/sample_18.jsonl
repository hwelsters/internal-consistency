We also know that the canoe trip took a certain amount of time, and the hiking trip took the remaining time. So:\n\nt_canoe + t_hiking = 5.5 hours\n\nWe can solve for t_canoe by using the formula distance = rate x time for the canoe trip and substituting d_canoe into the equation for total distance:\n\nd_canoe + d_hiking = 43.25 km\n12 km\/h x t_canoe + 5 km\/h x t_hiking = 43.25 km\n\nNow we can substitute t_hiking = 5.5 - t_canoe into the above equation and solve for d:\n\n12 km\/h x t_canoe + 5 km\/h x (5.5 - t_canoe) = 43.25 km\n\n12t_canoe + 27.5 - 5t_canoe = 43.25\n7t_canoe = 15.75\nt_canoe = 2.25 hours\n\nSo the canoe trip took 2.25 hours and the hiking trip took 5.5 - 2.25 = 3.25 hours.

What is the distance of the run and what is the distance of the bicycle race ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's call the distance of the run \"r\" and the distance of the bicycle race \"b\". \n\nStep 1: We can create two equations based on the information given: \n\nEquation 1: r + b = 90 (since the total distance of the biathlon is 90 miles) \n\nEquation 2: r\/7 + b\/26 = 5 (since the time it takes to complete the race is 5 hours) \n\nStep 2: Now we can solve for r and b using these equations. \n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 26, we get: \n\n26r + 26b = 2340 \n\nMultiplying equation 2 by 182 (the least common multiple of 7 and 26), we get: \n\n26r + 7b = 910 \n\nNow we can use these two equations to solve for r and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: \n\n19b = 1430 \n\nb = 75 \n\nSubstituting b = 75 into equation 1, we get: \n\nr + 75 = 90 \n\nr = 15 \n\nSo the distance of the run is 15 miles and the distance of the bicycle race is 75 miles. \n\nThe answer is: the distance of the run is 15 miles and the distance of the bicycle race is 75 miles.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

It takes 30 minutes for this boat to go back upstream the same 16 miles . Find the speed of the current .\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by defining some variables:\n- Let's call the speed of the boat in still water \"b\" (in miles per minute)\n- Let's call the speed of the current \"c\" (in miles per minute)\n\nWe know that downstream (with the current), the effective speed of the boat is b + c. We also know that upstream (against the current), the effective speed of the boat is b - c. Finally, we know the distance traveled in both directions is 16 miles.\n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can write two equations:\n- 16 = (b + c) x (20\/60)  (20\/60 represents the 20 minutes converted into hours)\n- 16 = (b - c) x (30\/60)  (30\/60 represents the 30 minutes converted into hours)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (b and c) that we can solve by using algebra. \n\nLet's start by simplifying the equations:\n- 16 = (b + c) x (1\/3)\n- 16 = (b - c) x (1\/2)\n\nMultiplying both sides of the first equation by 3 and both sides of the second equation by 2, we get:\n- 48 = b + c\n- 32 = b - c\n\nNow we can solve for one of the variables. Let's add the two equations together:\n48 + 32 = b + c + b - c\n80 = 2b\nb = 40\n\nSo the speed of the boat in still water is 40 miles per minute. Now we can substitute this value into one of the previous equations to solve for c:\n48 = 40 + c\nc = 8\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 8 miles per minute.\n\nThe answer is \"the speed of the current is 8 miles per minute.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

It's possible that the problem meant to say \"Alexis' age is one hundred sixty-two more than three times the age of Alyssa.\" In that case, we would set up the second equation as: \n\nA = 3B + 162 \n\nAnd when we solve the system of equations, we get: \n\nB = -22 \n\nA = 3(-22) + 162 = 96 \n\nSo the answer is: \nThe current age of Alexis is 96 and the current age of Alyssa is -22. However, since Alyssa's age cannot be negative, it is likely that there was an error in the problem and the actual age of Alyssa is 22. Therefore, the current age of Alexis is 96 and the current age of Alyssa is 22.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The problem states that Alex will be three times as old as Precy at that point, hence the equation. \n\nFrom the second sentence of the problem, we can also derive an equation: \n\nx - 1 = 7(y - 1) \n\nThis is because a year ago, Alex was x - 1 years old, and his sister Precy was y - 1 years old.

We can rearrange the first equation to get S in terms of M:\n\nM = 2S + 1\n2S = M - 1\nS = (M - 1)\/2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for S in the second equation:\n\nM - S = 18\nM - (M - 1)\/2 = 18\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n2M - (M - 1) = 36\nSimplify:\nM + 1 = 36\nM = 35\n\nSo Monica is 35 years old.

On the way back to school she averaged 30 mph . If the total driving time was 1.5 hours , how long did it take her to drive each way .\n\n\n","response":"Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time\n\nLet's call the distance from school to home \"D\" and the time it takes to drive from school to home \"t1\". Similarly, let's call the time it takes to drive from home to school \"t2\". \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\nD = 20t1  (since Danielle averaged 20 mph on the way from school to home)\nD = 30t2  (since Danielle averaged 30 mph on the way from home to school)\nt1 + t2 = 1.5 (since the total driving time was 1.5 hours)\n\nNow we can solve for t1 and t2 using substitution:\n\n20t1 = 30t2  (from the first two equations)\nt1 = 1.5 - t2  (from the third equation)\n\nSubstituting t1 in terms of t2:\n\n20(1.5 - t2) = 30t2\n30t2 - 20t2 = 30\n10t2 = 30\nt2 = 3\n\nNow we can find t1:\n\nt1 = 1.5 - t2\nt1 = 1.5 - 3\nt1 = -1.5\n\nWait, that's a negative time! This doesn't make sense.\n\nWe made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made an error when we assumed that the distance from school to home and the distance from home to school were the same. In reality, they might have been different. Let's call the distance from school to home \"D1\" and the distance from home to school \"D2\".\n\nNow the equations become:\n\nD1 = 20t1\nD2 = 30t2\nD1 + D2 = total distance\nt1 + t2 = 1.5\n\nWe don't know the total distance, but we don't need to. We just need to solve for t1 and t2. Using the same substitution method as before:\n\nD1 = 20t1\nD2 = 30t2\nt1 + t2 = 1.5\n\n20t1 + 30t2 = total distance\n20t1 + 20t2 = 30\n\n10t2 = 30\nt2 = 3\n\nt1 = 1.5 - t2\nt1 = 1.5 - 3\nt1 = -1.5\n\nOops, we made the same mistake again. Let's think about this. If Danielle drove at an average speed of 20 mph for some distance, and then drove at an average speed of 30 mph for the same distance, which leg of the trip would take longer? The leg where she drove at 20 mph, right? So t1 should be greater than t2, not less than.\n\nIt turns out that there is no solution to this problem as written. The problem is underdetermined. We need more information to solve it. Specifically, we need to know the total distance travelled. Without that information, we can't determine how long it took Danielle to drive each way.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

When he returned , there was less traffic and the trip took only 5 hours . If John averaged 12 mph faster on the return trip , how fast did John travel in each direction ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's use the following variables:\n- Let's call the distance to the city \"d\".\n- Let's call John's speed on his way to the city \"x\".\n- Let's call John's speed on his way back \"y\".\n\nWe can start by using the formula: distance = speed * time.\n\nOn John's way to the city, he traveled a distance \"d\" in 6 hours at a speed of \"x\". Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nd = 6x\n\nOn John's way back from the city, he also traveled the same distance \"d\" but in 5 hours at a speed of \"y\" which was 12 mph faster than his speed on his way to the city. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nd = 5y\n\nWe also know that John's speed on his way back was 12 mph faster than his speed on his way to the city. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\ny = x + 12\n\nNow we have three equations and three variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other two and substitute it into the other equations.\n\nFrom the equation d = 6x, we can solve for x:\n\nx = d\/6\n\nFrom the equation d = 5y, we can solve for y:\n\ny = d\/5\n\nSubstituting these two expressions for x and y into the equation y = x + 12, we get:\n\nd\/5 = d\/6 + 12\n\nMultiplying both sides by 30 (the least common multiple of 5 and 6) to clear the fractions, we get:\n\n6d = 5d + 360\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd = 360\n\nNow we can substitute this value of d back into the expressions we found for x and y:\n\nx = d\/6 = 60\ny = d\/5 = 72\n\nTherefore, John traveled at a speed of 60 mph on his way to the city and 72 mph on his way back. \n\nThe answer is: John traveled at a speed of 60 mph on his way to the city and 72 mph on his way back.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

How many tickets of each type were sold ?\n\n\n","response":"Let x be the number of single tickets sold and y be the number of couple tickets sold. We can create the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 128   (equation 1, because 128 people attended)\n20x + 35y = 2280   (equation 2, because ticket sales totaled $2280)\n\nSolving for x in equation 1, we get: x = 128 - y\n\nSubstituting x in equation 2, we get:\n\n20(128 - y) + 35y = 2280\n2560 - 20y + 35y = 2280\n15y = 280\ny = 18.67\n\nSince we cannot have a fractional number of tickets, we round y up to 19. \n\nSubstituting y = 19 into x = 128 - y, we get:\n\nx = 128 - 19\nx = 109\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 'the answer is 109 single tickets and 19 couple tickets were sold.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
