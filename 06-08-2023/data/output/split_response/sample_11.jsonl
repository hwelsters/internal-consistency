The boat makes a trip upstream to a certain point in 20 minutes ; the return trip takes 15 minutes . What is the speed of the current ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by setting up the algebraic system of equations. \n\nLet's call the speed of the current \"c\" (in miles per hour). \n\nFor the upstream trip: \n- The speed of the boat relative to the water is 16 miles per hour. \n- The speed of the current is c miles per hour, but it is going against the boat, so the effective speed of the current is (16 - c) miles per hour. \n- The distance traveled is the same for both the upstream and downstream trips (since the boat ends up at the same point). Let's call this distance \"d\". \n- The time it takes to travel upstream is 20 minutes, or 1\/3 of an hour. \n- Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can write the equation: d = (16 - c) x (1\/3)\n\nFor the downstream trip: \n- The speed of the boat relative to the water is still 16 miles per hour. \n- The speed of the current is c miles per hour, but it is now going with the boat, so the effective speed of the current is (16 + c) miles per hour. \n- The distance traveled is still \"d\". \n- The time it takes to travel downstream is 15 minutes, or 1\/4 of an hour. \n- Using the same formula, we can write the equation: d = (16 + c) x (1\/4)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (c and d). We can solve for c by setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for c: \n\n(16 - c) x (1\/3) = (16 + c) x (1\/4)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12 to get rid of the fractions: \n\n4(16 - c) = 3(16 + c)\n\n64 - 4c = 48 + 3c\n\nSimplifying: \n\n7c = 16 \n\nc = 16\/7 \n\nSo the speed of the current is 16\/7 miles per hour. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the speed of the current is 16\/7 miles per hour.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

In total 4500 tickets were sold worth $ 30000 . How many of each type of ticket were sold ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Let's call the number of section A tickets sold \"x\" and the number of section B tickets sold \"y\". \n- The cost of one section A ticket is $8, so the revenue from selling \"x\" section A tickets is 8x. \n- The cost of one section B ticket is $4.25, so the revenue from selling \"y\" section B tickets is 4.25y.\n- The total number of tickets sold is 4500, so x + y = 4500.\n- The total revenue is $30,000, so 8x + 4.25y = 30000.\n\nStep 2: We have two equations: x + y = 4500 and 8x + 4.25y = 30000. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. Here's one way to use elimination: \n- Multiply the first equation (x + y = 4500) by -8 to get -8x - 8y = -36000.\n- Add this equation to the second equation (8x + 4.25y = 30000) to eliminate the x term: -8x - 8y + 8x + 4.25y = -36000 + 30000.\n- Simplify: -3.75y = -6000.\n- Solve for y: y = 1600.\n- Use this value of y to solve for x using either equation: x + 1600 = 4500, so x = 2900.\n\nThe answer is: 2900 section A tickets and 1600 section B tickets were sold.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Similarly, when it's going upstream, it's going against the current, so its effective speed is: b - s.\n\nNow we can use the formula: distance = rate x time.\n\nWhen the boat is going downstream:\ndistance = 60 miles\nrate = b + s\ntime = 3 hours\n\nSo we can write: 60 = (b + s) x 3\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 20 = b + s\n\nWhen the boat is going upstream:\ndistance = 60 miles (since it's going back to its starting point)\nrate = b - s\ntime = 12 hours\n\nSo we can write: 60 = (b - s) x 12\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 5 = b - s\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables.

We know that the total distance of the trip is 70 miles, so we subtract d from 70 to get the distance he rode at 12 miles per hour. We also know that the total time of the trip is 4.5 hours, so we subtract t from 4.5 to get the time he spent riding at 12 miles per hour.\n\nStep 2:\nLet's solve for t in Equation 1 and substitute it into Equation 2:\n\nd = 20t\nt = d\/20\n\n70 - d = 12(4.5 - t)\n70 - d = 54 - 12(d\/20)\n70 - d = 54 - (3\/5)d\n(2\/5)d = 16\nd = 40\n\nNow that we know d = 40, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find t:\n\nd = 20t\n40 = 20t\nt = 2\n\nTherefore, Bret rode for 2 hours at 20 miles per hour before slowing down.

Draining the pool requires 20 hours . If the pool is empty and the drain is open how much time will be needed to fill the pool ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the rate of filling the pool as f and the rate of draining the pool as d. We can use the formula:\n\nrate = amount of work done \/ time\n\nFor filling the pool, the rate is f and the amount of work is 1 (the whole pool). For draining the pool, the rate is -d (negative because it's removing water) and the amount of work is also 1 (emptying the whole pool).\n\nNow we can set up the system of equations:\n\nf - d = 1\/10  (filling the pool takes 10 hours)\n-d = 1\/20  (draining the pool takes 20 hours)\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for d:\n\nd = -1\/20\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we can solve for f:\n\nf - (-1\/20) = 1\/10\nf = 1\/10 - (-1\/20)\nf = 3\/20\n\nSo the rate of filling the pool is 3\/20 of the pool per hour. To find out how much time is needed to fill the pool, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = amount of work \/ rate\n\nThe amount of work is 1 (the whole pool) and the rate is 3\/20.

Let's use substitution:\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can solve for z: z = 24 - x - y\nSubstitute this into Equation 2 and simplify: 10x + 14y + 20(24 - x - y) = 384\nSimplify further: 10x + 14y + 480 - 20x - 20y = 384\nCombine like terms: -10x - 6y = -96\nSimplify and divide by -2: 5x + 3y = 48\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables:\n\nEquation 3: 0.95x + 1.15y + 1.5z = 30.6\n5x + 3y = 48\n\nSolve for one variable in terms of the other in the second equation: y = (48 - 5x)\/3\nSubstitute this into the first equation and simplify:\n\n0.95x + 1.15[(48 - 5x)\/3] + 1.5z = 30.6\nMultiply by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2.85x + 1.15(48 - 5x) + 4.5z = 91.8\nSimplify and substitute z = 24 - x - y:\n\n2.85x + 55.2 - 5.75x + 4.5(24 - x - (48 - 5x)\/3) = 91.8\nSimplify and solve for x:\n\n-2.25x + 78 = 91.8\n-2.25x = 13.8\nx = -6.1333 (ignore this as it is not a valid solution)\n\nWe can now solve for y and z:\n\ny = (48 - 5x)\/3 = 7.6\nz = 24 - x - y = 12.3333\n\nTherefore, Kyle sold 7 10 oz. cups, 7 14 oz. cups, and 10 20 oz. cups during the busy period.\n\nThe answer is: Kyle sold 7 10 oz. cups, 7 14 oz. cups, and 10 20 oz. cups during the busy period.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
