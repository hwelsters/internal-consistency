If Bill was going 2 miles per hour faster than Chris , how fast was each of the bicycles going ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n\nLet's use the variable 'B' to represent Bill's rate (in miles per hour) and 'C' to represent Chris's rate.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- Bill traveled for 0.5 hours at his rate B\n- Chris traveled for 0.5 hours at his rate C\n- They were 14 miles apart after 0.5 hours\n\nSo we can set up two equations:\n\nDistance traveled by Bill = B(0.5)\nDistance traveled by Chris = C(0.5)\n\nAnd the difference between their distances is 14:\n\nB(0.5) - C(0.5) = 14\n\nWe also know that Bill was going 2 miles per hour faster than Chris, so:\n\nB = C + 2\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nB(0.5) - C(0.5) = 14\nB = C + 2\n\nLet's solve for one variable in terms of the other. We can rearrange the second equation to get:\n\nC = B - 2\n\nNow we can substitute this into the first equation:\n\nB(0.5) - (B-2)(0.5) = 14\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.5B - 0.5B + 1 = 14\n1 = 14\nThis is not possible, so we made a mistake. Let's go back to the equations and try a different approach.\n\nWe know that the total distance they traveled in 0.5 hours is 14 miles, since they were that far apart. So we can set up an equation:\n\nB(0.5) + C(0.5) = 14\n\nAnd we still have the equation:\n\nB = C + 2\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n\n(C+2)(0.5) + C(0.5) = 14\n\nSimplifying:\n\n1.5C + 1 = 14\n1.5C = 13\nC = 8.67\n\nSo Chris was going 8.67 miles per hour. To find Bill's speed, we can use the second equation:\n\nB = C + 2\nB = 8.67 + 2\nB = 10.67\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the speed of Bill's bicycle was 10.67 miles per hour, and the speed of Chris's bicycle was 8.67 miles per hour.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Three hours later , Car B leaves the same point travelling at 55 km\/h in the same direction . After how long will Car B over take Car A ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic system of equations\n\nLet d be the distance between the point and where Car B overtakes Car A.\nLet t be the time Car B takes to overtake Car A.\n\nThen, we can write the following equations:\n- Distance travelled by Car A = 45 * (t + 3)\n- Distance travelled by Car B = 55 * t\n- Distance travelled by Car B - Distance travelled by Car A = d\n\nStep 2: Final answer\n\nWe want to find the value of t when Car B overtakes Car A. This means that the distance travelled by Car B is equal to the distance travelled by Car A plus the distance between them.\n\nUsing the equations from Step 1, we can write:\n55t = 45(t + 3) + d\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n10t = 135 + d\n\nWe still need one more equation to solve for d. We can use the equation:\nDistance travelled by Car B - Distance travelled by Car A = d\n\nPlugging in the expressions for distance travelled by Car A and Car B, we get:\n55t - 45(t + 3) = d\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n10t - 135 = d\n\nNow we have two equations for d:\n10t = 135 + d\n10t - 135 = d\n\nSetting them equal to each other, we get:\n135 + d = 10t\nd = 10t - 135\n\nSubstituting this expression for d into one of the previous equations, we get:\n10t = 135 + (10t - 135)\n10t = 10t\n\nThis is a trivial equation, which means that any value of t will satisfy it. Therefore, we can choose any value of t that makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nFor example, we can choose t = 6, which means that Car B overtakes Car A 6 hours after Car B leaves the point.\n\nThen, using the equation d = 10t - 135, we can find the distance between Car A and Car B when Car B overtakes Car A:\nd = 10 * 6 - 135 = -75\n\nThe negative value of d means that Car A is 75 km ahead of Car B when Car B overtakes Car A. This is because Car B is travelling at a faster speed than Car A, but started 3 hours later. Therefore, Car A has covered more distance in those 3 hours.\n\nThe final answer is: \"Car B overtakes Car A 6 hours after Car B leaves the point.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The pump takes 6 hrs . A garden hose takes 10 hours . He wants to fill it up in a hurry . So he turns on the pump AND puts in the garden hose . Unfortunately , he leaves the drain open which will drain the pool in 8 hours . How long will it take to fill the pool ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic system of equations\nLet's denote the rate at which the pump fills the pool as R1, the rate at which the garden hose fills the pool as R2, and the rate at which the drain empties the pool as R3. We can use the formula rate = work\/time, where work is the amount of water that needs to be filled in the pool. Let's also denote the time it takes to fill the pool when both the pump and garden hose are turned on as T.\n\nWe know that the pump takes 6 hours to fill the pool, so its rate can be expressed as:\n\nR1 = work\/6\n\nSimilarly, the garden hose takes 10 hours to fill the pool, so its rate can be expressed as:\n\nR2 = work\/10\n\nThe drain empties the pool in 8 hours, so its rate can be expressed as:\n\nR3 = work\/8\n\nWhen both the pump and garden hose are turned on, their rates are added, so we can write:\n\nR1 + R2 = work\/T\n\nNow we have four equations and four unknowns. We can solve for the work and then use it to find the time it takes to fill the pool.\n\nStep 2: Solving for the time it takes to fill the pool\nTo solve for the work, we can use the fact that the amount of water in the pool remains constant when both the pump and garden hose are turned on, but the drain is also open, so the amount of water in the pool decreases at the rate of the drain. We can express this as:\n\nR1 + R2 - R3 = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R1, R2, and R3, we get:\n\nwork\/6 + work\/10 - work\/8 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators (240), we get:\n\n40work + 24work - 30work = 0\n\n34work = 0\n\nwork = 0\n\nThis means that the pool is not being filled at all, which is not possible. This is because the rate at which the drain empties the pool is greater than the combined rate at which the pump and garden hose fill it up.

This gives us:\n\n150 = 2(a + (150 - 10a)\/10)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n150 = 2a + 15 - a\nSolving for a, we get:\n\na = 13.5\n\nTherefore, the speed of Bus A is 13.5 miles per hour.\n\nThe answer is: \"the speed of Bus A is 13.5 miles per hour.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

How much of each should he use ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: \n\nLet x be the amount (in lb) of the 60% gold metal needed.\nLet y be the amount (in lb) of the 40% gold metal needed.\n\nThe total amount of alloy needed is 12.4 lb.\nTherefore, we have the first equation:\n\nx + y = 12.4\n\nThe alloy must contain 50% gold. This means that the amount of gold in the alloy is half of the total weight of the alloy. We can express the amount of gold in each of the metals by multiplying the weight of the metal by the percentage of gold it contains. We get:\n\n0.6x + 0.4y = 0.5(12.4)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.6x + 0.4y = 6.2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\nx + y = 12.4\n0.6x + 0.4y = 6.2\n\nStep 2:\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution or elimination.

What is the rate of the boat in still water and what is the rate of the current ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the rate of the boat in still water as b and the rate of the current as c. \n\nStep 1: \nWhen going upstream, the effective speed of the boat is b - c. Distance = rate * time, so we have: \n\n300 = (b - c) * 5 \n\nWhen going downstream, the effective speed of the boat is b + c. Again, we have: \n\n300 = (b + c) * 2 \n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using algebra. \n\nStep 2: \nFrom the first equation, we can solve for b: \n\n300 = 5b - 5c \n60 = b - c \n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for b again: \n\n300 = 2b + 2c \n150 = b + c \n\nWe now have two equations for b and c, which we can solve simultaneously.

What is the planes speed in still air ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's call the speed of the plane in still air \"p\" and the speed of the wind \"w\". \n\nWhen flying with the tailwind, the plane's speed is increased by the speed of the wind, so we can set up the equation: \n\np + w = 900\/3 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\np + w = 300 \n\nWhen flying against the wind, the plane's speed is decreased by the speed of the wind, so we can set up the equation: \n\np - w = 900\/4 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\np - w = 225 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other using either equation and then substitute into the other equation to solve for the other variable. Let's solve for \"p\" in terms of \"w\" using the first equation: \n\np + w = 300 \n\np = 300 - w \n\nNow substitute this expression for \"p\" into the second equation: \n\n300 - w - w = 225 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n300 - 2w = 225 \n\nSubtracting 300 from both sides: \n\n-2w = -75 \n\nDividing by -2: \n\nw = 37.5 \n\nNow that we know the speed of the wind is 37.5 mph, we can substitute this value into either equation to solve for the speed of the plane in still air. Let's use the first equation: \n\np + w = 300 \n\np + 37.5 = 300 \n\nSubtracting 37.5 from both sides: \n\np = 262.5 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \"the plane's speed in still air is 262.5 mph.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The weight of the 10% solution is x\/2 (since x liters is half of the total 2 L solution), and the weight of the 5% solution is y\/2. So, we have:\n0.1x + 0.05y = 0.08(2)\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination. Let's solve by substitution:\nx = 2 - y (from the first equation)\n0.1(2 - y) + 0.05y = 0.16\n0.2 - 0.1y + 0.05y = 0.16\n-0.05y = -0.04\ny = 0.8\n\nSo, the chemist needs 0.8 L of the 5% acid solution and 1.2 L (2 - 0.8) of the 10% acid solution to make 2 L of an 8% acid solution.\n\nThe answer is the chemist needs 0.8 L of the 5% acid solution and 1.2 L of the 10% acid solution to make 2 L of an 8% acid solution.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

To do this, we'll multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 5, so that we can eliminate 'w'.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 8, we get:\n\n40p + 40w = 6400\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 5, we get:\n\n40p - 40w = 4000\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n80p = 10400\n\nDividing both sides by 80, we get:\n\np = 130\n\nNow that we know the value of 'p', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'w'. Let's use the first equation:\n\n(p + w) * 5 = 800 \n\nSubstituting p = 130, we get:\n\n(130 + w) * 5 = 800\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n650 + 5w = 800\n\nSubtracting 650 from both sides, we get:\n\n5w = 150\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nw = 30\n\nStep 3: Final answer\n\nTherefore, the plane's air speed is 130 mph and the speed of the wind is 30 mph. \n\nThe answer is 'the plane's air speed is 130 mph and the speed of the wind is 30 mph.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
