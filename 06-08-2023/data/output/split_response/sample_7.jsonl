The return trip takes four hours with the wind . What is the rate of the plane in still air , and what is the rate of the wind ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the rate of the plane in still air as \"p\" and the rate of the wind as \"w\". \n\nWe know that the distance traveled against the wind is 3600 km, and it took 5 hours. We can use the formula: distance = rate x time, to create the equation: \n\n3600 = (p - w) * 5 \n\nSimilarly, for the return trip, we know that the distance traveled with the wind is also 3600 km, but it took 4 hours. We can create the equation: \n\n3600 = (p + w) * 4 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using any method of our choice (substitution, elimination, etc.). \n\nLet's use elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 5, so that the coefficients of \"p\" will be equal and opposite: \n\n(1) 18000 = 4p - 4w \n\n(2) 18000 = 5p + 5w \n\nAdding the two equations, we get: \n\n36000 = 9p \n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get: \n\np = 4000 \n\nNow we can substitute this value of \"p\" into either equation to solve for \"w\". Let's use the first equation: \n\n3600 = (4000 - w) * 5 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n720 = 4000 - w \n\nw = 3280 \n\nTherefore, the rate of the plane in still air is 4000 km\/h, and the rate of the wind is 3280 km\/h. \n\nThe answer is: 'the rate of the plane in still air is 4000 km\/h, and the rate of the wind is 3280 km\/h'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

What is the speed of the wind , and the speed of the plane ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by defining some variables:\n- Let's call the speed of the plane \"p\"\n- Let's call the speed of the wind \"w\"\n\nWith these variables, we can create the following system of equations:\n1. p + w = 100\/60 (since the plane is traveling with a tail wind, its speed is p + w and the distance is 100 miles, which it covers in 60 minutes)\n2. p - w = 100\/(60+40) (since the plane is traveling against a head wind, its speed is p - w and the distance is still 100 miles, but this time it takes 40 more minutes to cover the distance)\n\nWe can simplify equation 2 by first finding a common denominator for the right-hand side:\np - w = 100\/100 = 1\nThen, we can add this equation to equation 1 to eliminate \"w\":\n2p = 100\/60 + 1\n2p = 4\/3 + 1\n2p = 7\/3\np = 7\/6\n\nNow that we know the speed of the plane, we can substitute this value into either equation 1 or 2 to find the speed of the wind. Let's use equation 1:\n7\/6 + w = 100\/60\nw = 100\/60 - 7\/6\nw = 5\/18\n\nTherefore, the speed of the plane is 7\/6 and the speed of the wind is 5\/18. \nThe answer is 'the speed of the plane is 7\/6 and the speed of the wind is 5\/18'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Against the current the same trip took 4.5 hours . find the rate of the motorboat in calm water and the rate of the current .\n\n\n","response":"Let's use the following variables:\n- Let \"b\" be the rate of the motorboat in calm water (in miles per hour)\n- Let \"c\" be the rate of the current (in miles per hour)\n\nWhen the motorboat travels with the current, its effective speed is increased by the speed of the current. So, the distance traveled is equal to the speed times the time:\n72 = (b + c) * 3\n\nWhen the motorboat travels against the current, its effective speed is decreased by the speed of the current. So, the distance traveled is again equal to the speed times the time:\n72 = (b - c) * 4.5\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve it by using the substitution method:\n\n- Solve the first equation for \"b + c\":\nb + c = 24\n\n- Solve the second equation for \"b - c\":\nb - c = 16\n\n- Add the two equations together:\n2b = 40\n\n- Solve for \"b\":\nb = 20\n\n- Substitute b = 20 into one of the equations to find c:\n20 + c = 24\nc = 4\n\nTherefore, the rate of the motorboat in calm water is 20 miles per hour, and the rate of the current is 4 miles per hour. \n\nThe answer is: \"the rate of the motorboat in calm water is 20 miles per hour, and the rate of the current is 4 miles per hour.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

We also know that at that time, Mary was 5 times as old as her son. So we can write the equation: \n\nM - 5 = 5(S - 5) \n\nExpanding the brackets: \n\nM - 5 = 5S - 25 \n\nM = 5S - 20 \n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that 3 years from now, Mary's age will be M + 3 and her son's age will be S + 3. We also know that at that time, Mary's age will be 8 less than three times her son's age. So we can write the equation: \n\nM + 3 = 3(S + 3) - 8 \n\nExpanding the brackets: \n\nM + 3 = 3S + 9 - 8 \n\nM + 3 = 3S + 1 \n\nM = 3S - 2 \n\nNow we have two equations for M in terms of S: \n\nM = 5S - 20 \n\nM = 3S - 2 \n\nWe can set them equal to each other and solve for S: \n\n5S - 20 = 3S - 2 \n\n2S = 18 \n\nS = 9 \n\nSo Mary's son is currently 9 years old. We can substitute this into either equation to find Mary's age: \n\nM = 5S - 20 = 5(9) - 20 = 25 \n\nSo Mary is currently 25 years old. \n\nStep 2: \nThe answer is Mary is currently 25 years old and her son is currently 9 years old.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Let's use \"t1\" to represent the time it took to fly east, and \"t2\" to represent the time it took to fly west. We can set up the following equation:\n\nt1 + t2 = 7\n\nStep 3: We can now use the formula distance = rate x time to set up two more equations. The distance flown east is equal to the rate (300 km\/h) times the time it took to fly east (t1):\n\nd = 300t1\n\nSimilarly, the distance flown west is equal to the rate (400 km\/h) times the time it took to fly west (t2):\n\nx = 400t2\n\nStep 4: We can use these equations to eliminate t1 and t2 and solve for the total distance flown by the plane.

Right before the work started , they received a new piece of machinery that helped them clean 10 more acres per day than originally planned . As a result of increased productivity in the last day before the deadline they only had to clean 30 acres . How many acres of wheat did the group of farmers have to clean ?\n\n\n","response":"Let x be the original number of acres they planned to clean per day.\nThen, the number of acres they cleaned in the last day before the deadline is (x + 10).\nWe can set up the following system of equations:\n(x)(d-1) + (x+10)(1) = 80, where d is the number of days they planned to work.\n(x)(d-2) + (x+10)(1) = 50, since they only had to clean 30 acres in the last day before the deadline.\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\nxd - x + 10 = 80\nxd - 2x + 10 = 50\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\nx = 30\nTherefore, the original number of acres they planned to clean per day was 30. \nThus, the total number of acres they had to clean is:\n30(d-1) + 40 = 80d - 50\nWhen they only had to clean 30 acres in the last day before the deadline, we get:\n30(d-2) + 40 = 80d - 50\nSolving for d in the second equation, we get:\nd = 3\nTherefore, the group of farmers had to clean:\n30(3-1) + 40 = 100 acres of wheat. \n\nThe answer is 100.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

In 20 years he will be only twice as old as his daughter . How old are the father and daughter now ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by assigning variables to represent the current ages of the father and daughter. Let f be the father's age and d be the daughter's age.\n\nFrom the first sentence in the problem, we know that:\n\nf = 4d\n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that in 20 years, the father's age will be twice his daughter's age. So:\n\nf + 20 = 2(d + 20)\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation to find the value of one variable.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for d:\n\nd = f\/4\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\nf + 20 = 2(d + 20)\nf + 20 = 2(f\/4 + 20)\nf + 20 = f\/2 + 40\nf\/2 = -20\nf = -40\n\nThis doesn't make sense since we can't have a negative age. We made an error somewhere in our calculations or assumption.\n\nLet's go back to our first equation and check our assumption. It says that the father is 4 times older than the daughter. This means that the father's age is 4 times the daughter's age PLUS the daughter's age. In other words, the father's age is 5 times the daughter's age. So let's correct our equation:\n\nf = 5d\n\nNow we can continue with our calculations:\n\nd = f\/5\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\nf + 20 = 2(d + 20)\nf + 20 = 2(f\/5 + 20)\nf + 20 = 2f\/5 + 40\n3f\/5 = 20\nf = 100\/3\n\nSo the father is 100\/3 years old, or about 33.33 years old.\n\nTo find the daughter's age, we can use either of the equations we derived earlier:\n\nd = f\/5 = (100\/3)\/5 = 20\/3\n\nSo the daughter is 20\/3 years old, or about 6.67 years old.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 'the father is 100\/3 years old and the daughter is 20\/3 years old'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

After a time he became a little tired and slowed down to 12 miles per hour for the rest of the trip . The entire trip of 70 miles took 4.5 hours . How far had bret ridden when he reduced his speed to 12 miles per hour ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: \nLet d be the distance Bret rode at 20 miles per hour. \nLet t be the time (in hours) it took Bret to ride d miles at 20 miles per hour. \nThen, the distance Bret rode at 12 miles per hour is 70 - d. \nThe time Bret rode at 12 miles per hour is 4.5 - t. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\nd = 20t\n70 - d = 12(4.5 - t)\n\nStep 2: \nSimplify the second equation: \n\n70 - d = 54 - 12t + d \n16 = 12t - d \n\nSubstitute d = 20t from the first equation into the second equation: \n\n16 = 12t - 20t \n-4t = 16 \nt = -4 \n\nThis is not a valid solution since time cannot be negative. \n\nLet's check our work: \n\nIf Bret rode the entire 70 miles at 20 miles per hour, it would take him 3.5 hours. \nIf Bret rode the entire 70 miles at 12 miles per hour, it would take him 5.83 hours. \n\nSince his actual time of 4.5 hours is between these two extremes, we know that he rode some distance at 20 miles per hour and some distance at 12 miles per hour. \n\nLet's try a different approach: \n\nUsing the first equation, we know that t = d\/20. \n\nSubstitute this into the second equation: \n\n70 - d = 12(4.5 - d\/20) \n70 - d = 54 - 0.6d \n16 = 0.4d \nd = 40 \n\nTherefore, Bret rode 40 miles at 20 miles per hour before slowing down to 12 miles per hour. \n\nThe answer is 'the answer is 40'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

We know that the 1% solution has 0.01 grams of salt per milliliter of solution, and the 9% solution has 0.09 grams of salt per milliliter of solution. So:\n\n0.01x + 0.09y = 5 * 0.0324  (since we want 5 liters of a 3.24% solution)\n\nSimplifying the second equation:\n\n0.01x + 0.09y = 0.162\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination.

If part of the money returned 4 % and the remainder 2.25 % , then how much did she invest at each rate ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's call the amount Donna invested at 4% x, and the amount she invested at 2.25% y. We know that x + y = 33,000 (since that's the total amount she invested), and we also know that the interest she earned from the 4% investment plus the interest she earned from the 2.25% investment added up to $970. That can be expressed as:\n\n0.04x + 0.0225y = 970\n\nWe now have two equations and two variables, so we can solve for x and y. First, we'll use the equation x + y = 33,000 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 33,000 - x\n\nNow we can substitute that expression for y into the other equation and solve for x:\n\n0.04x + 0.0225(33,000 - x) = 970\n\n0.04x + 742.5 - 0.0225x = 970\n\n0.0175x = 227.5\n\nx = 13,000\n\nSo Donna invested $13,000 at 4% and $20,000 at 2.25%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: 'the answer is Donna invested $13,000 at 4% and $20,000 at 2.25%'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

How much did he invest in each method -LRB- savings bank and bond -RRB- if his annual income from the two investments was $ 660 ?\n\n\n","response":"Let x be the amount invested in the bank at 5% interest, and y be the amount invested in bonds at 9% interest. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 10000 (since the total amount invested is $10,000)\n0.05x + 0.09y = 660 (since the annual income from the two investments is $660)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the substitution method. Solving for x in the first equation, we get x = 10000 - y. Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:\n\n0.05(10000 - y) + 0.09y = 660\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n500 - 0.05y + 0.09y = 660\n\n0.04y = 160\n\ny = 4000\n\nSo Little Johnny invested $4,000 in bonds at 9% interest.

What is the speed of the current and the speed of the boat in still water ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as \"b\" and the speed of the current as \"c\". \n\nStep 1: \nFrom the problem, we can set up the following system of equations: \n\nEquation 1: 96 = (b - c) * 8 \nExplanation: The boat traveled 96 miles in 8 hours against the current, so we can use the formula distance = rate * time with (b - c) as the boat's speed relative to the water. \n\nEquation 2: 96 = (b + c) * 5 \nExplanation: The boat traveled the same 96 miles back to its starting point following the same course traveling with the current, so we can again use the distance = rate * time formula with (b + c) as the boat's speed relative to the water. \n\nStep 2: \nLet's solve for \"c\" in Equation 1: \n\n96 = (b - c) * 8 \n12 = b - c \nc = b - 12 \n\nNow let's substitute this expression for \"c\" into Equation 2: \n\n96 = (b + c) * 5 \n96 = (b + (b - 12)) * 5 \n96 = (2b - 12) * 5 \n96 = 10b - 60 \n156 = 10b \nb = 15.6 \n\nFinally, we can substitute this value of \"b\" back into the expression we found for \"c\" earlier: \n\nc = b - 12 \nc = 15.6 - 12 \nc = 3.6 \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the speed of the current is 3.6 mph and the speed of the boat in still water is 15.6 mph.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
