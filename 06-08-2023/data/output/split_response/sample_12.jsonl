How old are Jenna and Darius ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic system of equations\nLet's use J for Jenna's age and D for Darius's age.\nFrom the problem, we have two pieces of information:\n1. Jenna is 5 years older than Darius: J = D + 5\n2. The sum of their ages is 21 years: J + D = 21\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve to find the values of J and D.\n\nStep 2: Solving the system of equations\nWe can use substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations. Let's use substitution:\nSubstitute J = D + 5 from the first equation into the second equation:\n(D + 5) + D = 21\n2D + 5 = 21\n2D = 16\nD = 8\n\nNow we know that Darius is 8 years old.

What does the online service charge per hour for regular and premium service ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's use x to represent the hourly rate for regular use and y to represent the hourly rate for premium use.\n\nFrom the first scenario, we can create the equation:\n\n2y + 9x = 28\n\nFrom the second scenario, we can create the equation:\n\n3y + 6x = 27\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n2y + 9x = 28\n3y + 6x = 27\n\nWe can solve this system by using substitution or elimination.

At the same time another plane took off from the same airport , traveling west . The plane traveling east was going 120 miles per hour faster than the plane traveling west . After three hours , the planes were 2,400 miles apart . How fast was each plane going ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: \n\nLet's call the speed of the plane traveling west \"x\" (in miles per hour). \n\nSince the plane traveling east is going 120 miles per hour faster than the plane traveling west, its speed can be represented as \"x + 120\" (in miles per hour). \n\nWe know that both planes traveled for three hours, so we can use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nFor the plane traveling west: \ndistance = x * 3 \n\nFor the plane traveling east: \ndistance = (x + 120) * 3 \n\nWe also know that the planes were 2,400 miles apart after three hours, so we can set up an equation: \n\ndistance of westbound plane + distance of eastbound plane = 2,400 \n\nx * 3 + (x + 120) * 3 = 2,400 \n\nStep 2: \n\nLet's simplify the equation: \n\n3x + 3(x + 120) = 2,400 \n\n3x + 3x + 360 = 2,400 \n\n6x + 360 = 2,400 \n\n6x = 2,040 \n\nx = 340 \n\nSo the speed of the plane traveling west is 340 miles per hour. \n\nTo find the speed of the plane traveling east: \n\nspeed of eastbound plane = x + 120 \nspeed of eastbound plane = 340 + 120 \nspeed of eastbound plane = 460 \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the speed of the westbound plane is 340 miles per hour and the speed of the eastbound plane is 460 miles per hour.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Therefore, the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of (a + b) miles per hour (since they are driving towards each other).

We can use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nTherefore, we get two equations: \n\n(b - c) x 5 = 300 \n\n(b + c) x 2 = 300 \n\nStep 2: \nSimplifying the equations: \n\n5b - 5c = 300 \n\n2b + 2c = 300 \n\nWe can now solve for one variable in terms of the other: \n\n5b - 5c = 300 \n\nb - c = 60 \n\nb = c + 60 \n\nSubstituting this value of b into the second equation: \n\n2(c + 60) + 2c = 300 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n4c + 120 = 300 \n\n4c = 180 \n\nc = 45 \n\nNow that we know the rate of the current, we can substitute it back into the equation b = c + 60 to find the rate of the boat in still water: \n\nb = 45 + 60 \n\nb = 105 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: 'the rate of the boat in still water is 105 mph and the rate of the current is 45 mph'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

After a time he became a little tired and slowed down to 12 miles per hour for the rest of the trip . The entire trip of 70 miles took 4.5 hours . How far had bret ridden when he reduced his speed to 12 miles per hour ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic system of equations\n\nLet's use d to represent the distance Bret rode at 20 miles per hour before slowing down, and t to represent the time he spent at that speed. We can then use the formula distance = rate \u00c3\u2014 time to create an equation:\n\nd = 20t\n\nNext, we need to find the distance Bret rode at 12 miles per hour. We know he rode a total of 70 miles, and we already found that he rode d miles at 20 miles per hour. So he must have ridden (70 - d) miles at 12 miles per hour. Let's use s to represent the time he spent at that speed. Using the same formula as before, we get:\n\n70 - d = 12s\n\nFinally, we know that the entire trip took 4.5 hours. We can use this to create a third equation:\n\nt + s = 4.5\n\nWe now have three equations and three variables, which we can solve to find the value of d.\n\nStep 2: Solve for d\n\nLet's solve the third equation for t:\n\nt = 4.5 - s\n\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\nd = 20(4.5 - s)\n\nSimplify:\n\nd = 90 - 20s\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n70 - (90 - 20s) = 12s\n\nSimplify:\n\n160 - 20s = 12s\n\nAdd 20s to both sides:\n\n160 = 32s\n\nDivide both sides by 32:\n\ns = 5\n\nNow we can use this value of s to find d:\n\nd = 90 - 20s\n\nd = 90 - 20(5)\n\nd = 90 - 100\n\nd = -10\n\nWait, a negative distance doesn't make sense! What went wrong?\n\nLooking back at the problem, we can see that Bret couldn't have ridden a negative distance at 20 miles per hour. This means our assumption that he rode d miles at that speed was incorrect. Instead, he must have ridden the entire 70 miles at 20 miles per hour before slowing down. Let's adjust our algebraic system of equations accordingly:\n\nd = 70\ns = (4.5 - t)\n70 = 20t + 12s\nt + s = 4.5\n\nNow we can solve for t and s:\n\nt = 3\ns = 1.5\n\nAnd finally, we can use these values to find the distance Bret rode at 20 miles per hour:\n\nd = 20t = 20(3) = 60\n\nTherefore, Bret rode 60 miles at 20 miles per hour before slowing down to 12 miles per hour. \n\nThe answer is Bret rode 60 miles at 20 miles per hour before slowing down to 12 miles per hour.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
