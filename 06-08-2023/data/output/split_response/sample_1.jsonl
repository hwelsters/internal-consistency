Therefore, we have the equation: 372 = 4(r + s).\n- Against the moving sidewalk, the child covers 165 meters in 3 minutes, so the child's speed is r - s. Therefore, we have the equation: 165 = 3(r - s).\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations:\n- Expanding the first equation, we get: 372 = 4r + 4s\n- Expanding the second equation, we get: 165 = 3r - 3s\n- Multiplying the second equation by 4, we get: 660 = 12r - 12s\n- Adding the two equations, we eliminate s and get: 1032 = 16r\n- Dividing by 16, we get: r = 64.5\n\nNow we can plug r into one of the original equations to find s:\n372 = 4(r + s)\n372 = 4(64.5 + s)\n372 = 258 + 4s\n4s = 114\ns = 28.5\n\nTherefore, the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 64.5 meters per minute, and the speed of the moving sidewalk is 28.5 meters per minute. \n\nThe answer is 'the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 64.5 meters per minute, and the speed of the moving sidewalk is 28.5 meters per minute.'","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The least common multiple of 9 and 6 is 18, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n2W\/18 + 3W\/18 = W\/x\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n5W\/18 = W\/x\n\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get:\n5W = 18W\/x\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\nW = 3.6W\/x\n\nDividing both sides by W, we get:\n1 = 3.6\/x\n\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get:\nx = 3.6\n\nSo, the answer is:\nthe answer is 3.6 hours.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The distance they cover is 140 km, and the time it takes to meet is 48 minutes (or 0.8 hours). Therefore, we can write:\n\n140 = (r1 + r2) * 0.8\n\nWhen the cars are driven in the same direction, they are getting farther apart at a rate of r2 - r1. The distance they cover is also 140 km, but this time it takes 240 minutes (or 4 hours) to meet. Therefore, we can write:\n\n140 = (r2 - r1) * 4\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of r1 and r2.\n\nStep 2: Final Answer\n\nLet's rewrite the equations in a more convenient form:\n\n0.8r1 + 0.8r2 = 140\/1\n4r2 - 4r1 = 140\/1\n\nWe can use the second equation to express r2 in terms of r1:\n\n4r2 = 4r1 + 140\/1\nr2 = r1 + 35\/4\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\n0.8r1 + 0.8(r1 + 35\/4) = 140\/1\n1.6r1 + 28 = 140\/1\n1.6r1 = 112\/1\nr1 = 70\/4\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the first car is driven is 17.5 km\/h (since the distance is in km and the time is in hours).

To find the number of dimes, substitute Q = 29 into the equation we found earlier:\n\nD = 45 - Q\nD = 45 - 29\nD = 16\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"there are 29 quarters and 16 dimes\".","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

In this case, the net rate of filling the pool is:\n\nF - D\n\nSubstituting our values for F and D, we get:\n\nF - D = 1\/10 - 1\/20 = 1\/20\n\nSo the net rate of filling the pool is 1\/20 pool per hour. \n\nTo find out how much time is needed to fill the pool, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = amount \/ rate\n\nIn this case, the amount is 1 pool (since we want to fill the pool completely) and the rate is 1\/20 pool per hour (the net rate of filling the pool). So we get:\n\ntime = 1 \/ (1\/20) = 20 hours\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the answer is 20 hours'.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

What is the rate of each train if they meet in 5 hours ? thanks for the help !\n\n\n","response":"Let's start by setting up the algebraic system of equations:\n\nLet x be the speed of the slower train in mph\nThen x + 6 is the speed of the faster train in mph\n\nWe know that the two trains are traveling towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds:\n\nx + (x + 6) = 2x + 6\n\nWe also know that the total distance they travel is 450 miles, and they meet in 5 hours. So we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate * time\n\nFor the slower train, the distance it travels is:\n\nx * 5 = 5x\n\nFor the faster train, the distance it travels is:\n\n(x + 6) * 5 = 5x + 30\n\nThe sum of these distances is 450 miles:\n\n5x + 5x + 30 = 450\n10x = 420\nx = 42\n\nSo the speed of the slower train is 42 mph, and the speed of the faster train is:\n\nx + 6 = 42 + 6 = 48 mph\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the speed of the slower train is 42 mph, and the speed of the faster train is 48 mph.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1, we get:\n\n4x + 6y = 19.5\n-4x - 2y = -12.5\n\nAdding these two equations together, we eliminate x and get:\n\n4y = 7\n\nTherefore, y = 1.75. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we can solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(1.75) = 9.75\n2x + 5.25 = 9.75\n2x = 4.5\nx = 2.25\n\nSo bags of bagels cost $2.25 and packages of cream cheese cost $1.75.\n\nThe answer is bags of bagels cost $2.25 and packages of cream cheese cost $1.75.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Let's isolate z as z = (30.6 - 0.95x - 1.15y)\/1.5.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n4y + 10[(30.6 - 0.95x - 1.15y)\/1.5] = 144\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2y + 3(30.6 - 0.95x - 1.15y) = 72\n\nSubstituting x = 24 - y - z and z = (30.6 - 0.95x - 1.15y)\/1.5 into the equation above, we get:\n\n2y + 3(30.6 - 0.95(24 - y - (30.6 - 0.95x - 1.15y)\/1.5) - 1.15y) = 72\n\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\n\ny = 6\n\nSubstituting y = 6 into x + y + z = 24, we get:\n\nx + z = 18\n\nSubstituting y = 6 into z = (30.6 - 0.95x - 1.15y)\/1.5, we get:\n\nz = 4\n\nTherefore, Kyle filled 6 14 oz. cups, 4 20 oz. cups, and 14 10 oz. cups.\n\nThe answer is Kyle filled 6 14 oz. cups, 4 20 oz. cups, and 14 10 oz. cups.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
