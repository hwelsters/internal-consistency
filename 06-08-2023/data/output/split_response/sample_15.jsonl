The return trip takes four hours with the wind . What is the rate of the plane in still air , and what is the rate of the wind ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Produce the algebraic system of equations needed to solve the problem.\n\nLet's call the rate of the plane in still air \"p\" and the rate of the wind \"w\". We know that:\n\n- Against the wind, the plane's effective speed is p - w (since the wind is slowing it down). We also know that it takes 5 hours to travel 3600 km at this speed, so we can write:\n3600 = 5(p - w)\n\n- With the wind, the plane's effective speed is p + w (since the wind is helping it along). We know that it takes 4 hours to travel the same distance of 3600 km at this speed, so we can write:\n3600 = 4(p + w)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (p and w), so we can solve for them using algebra.\n\nStep 2: Output the final answer.\n\nWe'll start by simplifying the equations we derived in Step 1:\n\n- 3600 = 5p - 5w  (divide both sides by 5)\n720 = p - w\n\n- 3600 = 4p + 4w  (divide both sides by 4)\n900 = p + w\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n720 = p - w\n900 = p + w\n\nWe can solve for p by adding the two equations together:\n\n1620 = 2p\np = 810\n\nSo the rate of the plane in still air is 810 km\/h. \n\nTo find the rate of the wind, we can substitute this value back into either of the equations we derived earlier. Let's use the second one:\n\n900 = p + w\n900 = 810 + w\nw = 90\n\nSo the rate of the wind is 90 km\/h. \n\nThe answer is: the rate of the plane in still air is 810 km\/h, and the rate of the wind is 90 km\/h.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

One kind sells for $ 2.15 per pound and the other sells for 2.45 per pound . He wants to mix a total of 18 pounds and sell it for $ 2.30 per pound . How many pounds of each kind should he use in the new mix ?\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: Algebraic system of equations\n\nLet x be the number of pounds of the first kind of coffee and y be the number of pounds of the second kind of coffee.\n\nWe know that the grocer wants to mix a total of 18 pounds, so:\n\nx + y = 18\n\nWe also know the price per pound of each kind of coffee and the desired price per pound of the new mix. Using this information, we can set up an equation for the total cost of the new mix and the total revenue from selling the new mix:\n\nTotal cost = 2.15x + 2.45y\nTotal revenue = 2.30(18) = 41.40\n\nSince the grocer wants to make a profit, the total revenue should be greater than or equal to the total cost:\n\n2.15x + 2.45y \u2264 41.40\n\nStep 2: Final answer\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use the first equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\nx + y = 18\ny = 18 - x\n\nSubstituting y in the inequality equation, we get:\n\n2.15x + 2.45(18 - x) \u2264 41.40\n2.15x + 44.1 - 2.45x \u2264 41.40\n-0.3x \u2264 -2.7\nx = 9\n\nSo the grocer should use at least 9 pounds of the first kind of coffee. Using the first equation to solve for y, we get:\n\nx + y = 18\ny = 18 - x\ny = 18 - 9\ny = 9\n\nTherefore, the grocer should use 9 pounds of the first kind of coffee and 9 pounds of the second kind of coffee in the new mix.\n\nThe answer is \"the grocer should use 9 pounds of the first kind of coffee and 9 pounds of the second kind of coffee in the new mix.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Let's say this happened y years ago. \nAt that time, Ben's age was x - y and Bill's age was 2(x - y). \n\nWe can set up another equation based on this information: \n2(x - y) = (x - y) + y + B \n\nSimplifying: \n2x - 3y = B \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (3x - B = 91 and 2x - 3y = B).

Its distance traveled in 3 hours is:\n\ndistance = 2x * 3\n\nNow we're told that the two planes were 2700 miles apart after 3 hours. So we can set up an equation:\n\n2700 = x * 3 + 2x * 3\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2700 = 3x + 6x\n\n2700 = 9x\n\nx = 300\n\nSo the first plane was flying at 300 mph, and the second plane was flying at twice that speed, or 600 mph.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the speed of the first plane was 300 mph, and the speed of the second plane was 600 mph.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Using this corrected equation, we would get x = 33.33 and y = 66.67.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nThe merchant should use 33.33 pounds of coffee beans at $9 per pound and 66.67 pounds of coffee beans at $12 per pound to create a 100-pound mixture that will sell for $11.25 per pound.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
