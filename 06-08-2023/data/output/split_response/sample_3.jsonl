If it takes your brother 45 minutes to rake the yard, then his rate is 1\/45 of the yard per minute. \n\nWhen you work together, your combined rate is the sum of your individual rates: \n\n1\/30 + 1\/45 = 1\/18 \n\nThis means that you can rake 1\/18 of the yard per minute when you work together. \n\nUsing the formula time = work \/ rate, we can find the time it takes to rake the entire yard when you work together: \n\ntime = work \/ rate = 1 \/ (1\/18) = 18 minutes \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the answer is 18 minutes\".","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

We can create the following system of equations based on the information given:\n\nT + t = 21    (Tom and Tim's ages add up to 21 years)\nT + 3 = 2(t + 3)   (In 3 years, Tom will be twice Tim's age)\n\nStep 2: Solve for T and t\nLet's use the first equation to solve for one of the variables. We can isolate T by subtracting t from both sides:\n\nT + t - t = 21 - t\nT = 21 - t\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for T in the second equation:\n\n(21 - t) + 3 = 2(t + 3)\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n24 - t = 2t + 6\n\nAdding t to both sides, we get:\n\n24 = 3t + 6\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\n18 = 3t\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nt = 6\n\nNow that we know Tim's age is 6, we can use the first equation to solve for Tom's age:\n\nT + 6 = 21\nT = 15\n\nTherefore, Tom is 15 years old and Tim is 6 years old.\n\nThe answer is Tom is 15 years old and Tim is 6 years old.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

We also know that Mary was 5 times as old as her son, so we can write the equation: \n\nM-5 = 5(S-5) \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that 3 years from now, Mary's age will be M+3 and her son's age will be S+3. We also know that Mary's age will be 8 less than three times her son's age, so we can write the equation: \n\nM+3 = 3(S+3) - 8 \n\nStep 2: \nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for M and S. \n\nExpanding the second equation, we get: \n\nM+3 = 3S + 7 \n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get: \n\nM = 3S + 4 \n\nSubstituting this expression for M into the first equation, we get: \n\n3S + 4 - 5 = 5(S-5) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n3S - 1 = 5S - 25 \n\nSubtracting 3S from both sides, we get: \n\n-1 = 2S - 25 \n\nAdding 25 to both sides, we get: \n\n24 = 2S \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\nS = 12 \n\nNow we can substitute this value of S back into one of our earlier equations to solve for M.

We know that Frank runs eight miles farther than Ted in these two hours, so we can set up the equation:\n2x = (4\/3)x + 8\n\nStep 2: Solve for x\nTo solve for x, we'll first multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n6x = 4x + 24\nNext, we'll subtract 4x from both sides:\n2x = 24\nFinally, we'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\nx = 12\n\nStep 3: Find Ted's and Frank's speeds\nWe know that Ted's speed is two-thirds of Frank's speed, so we can find Ted's speed by multiplying Frank's speed by (2\/3):\nTed's speed = (2\/3)x = (2\/3)(12) = 8\n\nTherefore, Frank's speed is 12 mph and Ted's speed is 8 mph.\n\nThe answer is Frank's speed is 12 mph and Ted's speed is 8 mph.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The distance traveled is 16 miles and the time taken is 20 minutes (or 1\/3 of an hour). Therefore:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n16 = (b + c) x (1\/3)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n48 = b + c\n\nWhen the motorboat is going upstream, its speed is decreased by the speed of the current, so its effective speed is b - c. The distance traveled is still 16 miles, but the time taken is now 30 minutes (or 1\/2 of an hour). Therefore:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n16 = (b - c) x (1\/2)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n32 = b - c\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables.

We know that it travels 900 miles in 3 hours, so we can write the equation:\n\n900 = 3(s + w)\n\nWhen the plane is flying against the wind, its effective speed is s - w. We know that it travels the same 900 miles, but this time it takes 4 hours, so we can write the equation:\n\n900 = 4(s - w)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for s by using either substitution or elimination.\n\nUsing substitution:\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for w:\n900 = 3s + 3w\n300 = s + w\nw = 300 - s\n\nSubstitute this expression for w into the second equation:\n900 = 4(s - (300 - s))\n900 = 4(2s - 300)\n225 = 2s - 150\n375 = 2s\ns = 187.5\n\nUsing elimination:\nMultiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate w:\n3600 = 12s + 12w\n2700 = 12s - 12w\nAdd the two equations:\n6300 = 24s\ns = 262.5\n\nSince the plane's speed cannot be negative, we reject the solution s = 262.5.

How long will it take to fill the water tank with both pipes open .\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: \nLet x be the time it takes to fill the tank with both pipes open. \nThe inlet pipe can fill the tank at a rate of 1\/10 (because it takes 10 hours to fill the tank). \nThe outlet pipe can empty the tank at a rate of 1\/15 (because it takes 15 hours to empty the tank). \nWhen both pipes are open, they work against each other, so we subtract the rate of the outlet pipe from the rate of the inlet pipe to get the net rate of filling the tank: \n1\/10 - 1\/15 = 1\/x \n\nStep 2: \nTo solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for 1\/10 and 1\/15, which is 30. \n1\/10 - 1\/15 = 3\/30 - 2\/30 = 1\/30 \nSo, 1\/30 = 1\/x \nMultiplying both sides by 30, we get: \nx = 30 \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the answer is 30'.

What is the speed of the current and the speed of the boat in still water ?\n\n\n","response":"Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as \"b\" and the speed of the current as \"c.\"\n\nWhen the boat is traveling against the current, its effective speed is b-c. When it is traveling with the current, its effective speed is b+c.\n\nWe can use the formula distance = rate x time for both parts of the trip:\n\n96 = (b-c) x 8        (against the current)\n96 = (b+c) x 5        (with the current)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other:\n\nb-c = 12\nb+c = 19.2\n\nAdding these two equations together, we get:\n\n2b = 31.2\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nb = 15.6\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for c:\n\n15.6 - c = 12\n\nc = 3.6\n\nTherefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 15.6 mph and the speed of the current is 3.6 mph.\n\nThe answer is \"the speed of the boat in still water is 15.6 mph and the speed of the current is 3.6 mph.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

The eye-drop solution must have a 2 % active ingredient , but the pharmacist only has 10 % solution and 1 % solution in stock . How much of each type of solution should be used to fill the prescription .\n\n\n","response":"Step 1: \nLet x be the amount (in milliliters) of the 10% solution needed.\nLet y be the amount (in milliliters) of the 1% solution needed.\n\nWe know that the total volume of the solution needed is 15 milliliters, so:\nx + y = 15\n\nWe also know that the final solution must have a 2% active ingredient. The amount of active ingredient in the 10% solution is 0.1x (since the 10% solution is 10% active ingredient), and the amount of active ingredient in the 1% solution is 0.01y (since the 1% solution is 1% active ingredient). The total amount of active ingredient in the final solution must be 2% of 15 milliliters, or 0.3 milliliters. So:\n0.1x + 0.01y = 0.3\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two variables:\nx + y = 15\n0.1x + 0.01y = 0.3\n\nStep 2:\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Rearrange the first equation to solve for one of the variables:\nx = 15 - y\n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n0.1(15 - y) + 0.01y = 0.3\n\nSimplify and solve for y:\n1.5 - 0.1y + 0.01y = 0.3\n-0.09y = -1.2\ny = 13.33 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow use the first equation to solve for x:\nx + y = 15\nx + 13.33 = 15\nx = 1.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the pharmacist should use 1.67 milliliters of the 10% solution and 13.33 milliliters of the 1% solution to prepare the 15 milliliters of special eye drops for the glaucoma patient.\n\nThe answer is: the pharmacist should use 1.67 milliliters of the 10% solution and 13.33 milliliters of the 1% solution to prepare the 15 milliliters of special eye drops for the glaucoma patient.","n":20,"temperature":0.7}

Ticket sales totaled $ 2280 , and 128 people attended . How many tickets of each type were sold ?\n\n\n","response":"Let x be the number of single tickets sold and y be the number of couple tickets sold. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 128 (total number of people who attended)\n20x + 35y = 2280 (total revenue from ticket sales)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nx = 128 - y\n20(128 - y) + 35y = 2280\n2560 - 20y + 35y = 2280\n15y = 280\ny = 18.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSince we can't sell a fraction of a ticket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means that y = 19 and x = 128 - 19 = 109.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"109 single tickets and 19 couple tickets were sold.\"","n":20,"temperature":0.7}
