Let's call the speed of the plane \"p\" and the speed of the wind \"w\". \n\nWhen the plane is traveling with a tailwind, its effective speed is increased by the speed of the wind. So the equation for the distance traveled is:\n\n100 = (p+w) * (60/60) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n100 = p + w\n\nWhen the plane is traveling against the headwind, its effective speed is decreased by the speed of the wind. So the equation for the distance traveled is:\n\n100 = (p-w) * (60/60+40/60)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n100 = (p-w) * (5/3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3/5, we get:\n\n60 = p - w \n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination. We'll use substitution. \n\nFrom the first equation, we know that:\n\nw = 100 - p \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n60 = p - (100 - p)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n160 = 2p \n\nSo:\n\np = 80 \n\nNow that we know the speed of the plane, we can use either equation to solve for the speed of the wind.

So, d = 12 km/h * (some amount of time).\n- The distance they walked on the scenic trail can also be found using d = rt, where r is the speed and t is the time. We know that their total trip took 5.5 hours and they paddled for some amount of time, so they walked for (5.5 hours - paddling time).\n- Using the formula for average speed (total distance / total time), we know that their average speed for the entire trip was 43.25 km / 5.5 hours = 7.86 km/h.\n- We can use this information to create another equation: 43.25 km = (distance paddled) + d\n\nPutting it all together, we have the system of equations:\nd = 12t\n43.25 = (distance paddled) + d\nd = 5.5 - t\n\nStep 2: To solve for d, we'll need to eliminate t.

Let's solve for s:\ns = 846 - a\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation and solve for a:\n6a + 3(846 - a) = 3846\nDistribute the 3:\n6a + 2538 - 3a = 3846\nSimplify:\n3a + 2538 = 3846\nSubtract 2538 from both sides:\n3a = 1308\nDivide by 3:\na = 436\n\nNow that we know a = 436, we can use either of the original equations to solve for s:\ns = 846 - a\ns = 846 - 436\ns = 410\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \"The number of adult tickets sold was 436 and the number of student tickets sold was 410.\"\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Now we can plug this value back into one of the earlier equations to solve for c:\n\nb + c = 150\n105 + c = 150\nc = 45\n\nSo the rate of the current is 45 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the rate of the boat in still water is 105 miles per hour and the rate of the current is 45 miles per hour.'\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Let's call the amount of water filled by the old pump \"A\" and the amount of water filled by the new pump \"B\". Then we have:\n\nA/600 = 1  (since the old pump can fill the trough in 600 sec)\nB/200 = 1  (since the new pump can fill the trough in 200 sec)\n\nTo find the amount of water filled by both pumps working together, we can add their rates of water flow together. Let's call the amount of water filled by both pumps \"C\". Then we have:\n\nC/t = A/600 + B/200 \n\nNow we can solve for \"t\". First, let's solve for \"A\" and \"B\":\n\nA = 600\nB = 200\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for \"C\", we get:\n\nC/t = 600/600 + 200/200\nC/t = 1 + 1\nC/t = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by \"t\", we get:\n\nC = 2t\n\nSo the amount of water filled by both pumps working together is just twice the amount of water that one pump can fill. \n\nTo find the time it takes to fill the trough with both pumps at the same time, we can substitute this value of \"C\" into the equation for \"t\":\n\nC = 2t\nt = C/2\nt = (600*200)/(600+200)\nt = 150 seconds\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the answer is 150 seconds\".\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Let f be the father's current age, c1 be the age of the first child, and c2 be the age of the second child. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n- f = 2(c1 + c2)  (the age of the father is twice the sum of the ages of his two children)\n- f + 20 = c1 + 20 + c2 + 20  (after 20 years, his age will be equal to the sum of the ages of his children)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation to:\n\n- f + 20 = c1 + c2 + 40\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation. For example, we can solve the first equation for c1:\n\n- f = 2(c1 + c2)\n- f = 2c1 + 2c2\n- c1 = (f - 2c2)/2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for c1 into the second equation:\n\n- f + 20 = c1 + c2 + 40\n- f + 20 = ((f - 2c2)/2) + c2 + 40\n- f - 2c2 = 40\n\nWe can solve for f:\n\n- f - 2c2 = 40\n- f = 2c2 + 40\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for f into the first equation:\n\n- f = 2(c1 + c2)\n- 2c2 + 40 = 2(c1 + c2)\n- c1 = (2c2 + 40 - 2c2)/2\n- c1 = 20\n\nSo we have found that one of the children is 20 years old. We can use this to find the other child's age:\n\n- f = 2(c1 + c2)\n- 2c2 + 40 = 2(20 + c2)\n- 2c2 + 40 = 40 + 2c2\n- 0 = 0\n\nThis equation is true for all values of c2. So we can't determine the other child's age based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: the age of the father is 80, and one of his children is 20.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Then we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n3d + 150m = 132\n2d + 400m = 142\n\nTo solve for 'd' and 'm', we can use the method of elimination. Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by -3, we can eliminate 'd' and solve for 'm':\n\n12d + 600m = 528\n-6d - 1200m = -426\n\nAdding the two equations together, we get:\n\n6d + 0m = 102\n\nTherefore, d = 17.
