Going up the stream: distance = rate * time\n- The ship's speed relative to the stream is s - c (since it's going against the current)\n- Distance = 36 km\n- Time = 3 hours\n- Therefore, 36 = (s - c) * 3\n\n2. Going down the stream: distance = rate * time\n- The ship's speed relative to the stream is s + c (since it's going with the current)\n- Distance = 36 km\n- Time = 2 hours\n- Therefore, 36 = (s + c) * 2\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns (s and c), which we can solve using algebra. Let's start by simplifying each equation:\n\n1. 36 = 3s - 3c\n2. 36 = 2s + 2c\n\nNext, we can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for c in the first equation:\n\n1. 36 = 3s - 3c\n   12 = s - c\n   c = s - 12\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for c into the second equation and solve for s:\n\n2. 36 = 2s + 2c\n   36 = 2s + 2(s - 12)\n   36 = 4s - 24\n   60 = 4s\n   s = 15\n\nSo the speed of the ship is 15 km/h. To find the speed of the stream, we can substitute this value of s into our expression for c:\n\nc = s - 12\nc = 15 - 12\nc = 3\n\nTherefore, the speed of the stream is 3 km/h.\n\nThe answer is: \n- The km per hour for the ship is 15 km/h.\n- The km per hour for the stream is 3 km/h.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Their speed is the sum of their running speed and the speed of the moving sidewalk. \n\nEquation 2: (r - s) * 3 = 165 \nExplanation: The child covers 165 meters in 3 minutes while running in the opposite direction of the moving sidewalk. Their speed is the difference between their running speed and the speed of the moving sidewalk. \n\nStep 2: \nNow we can solve for r and s by using the two equations: \n\nEquation 1: \n4r + 4s = 372 \nr + s = 93 \n\nEquation 2: \n3r - 3s = 165 \nr - s = 55 \n\nNow we can use the elimination method to solve for r: \n\n(r + s) - (r - s) = 93 - 55 \n2s = 38 \ns = 19 \n\nSubstitute s = 19 into one of the equations to solve for r: \n\nr + 19 = 93 \nr = 74 \n\nTherefore, the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 74 meters per minute, and the speed of the moving sidewalk is 19 meters per minute. \n\nThe answer is: the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 74 meters per minute, and the speed of the moving sidewalk is 19 meters per minute.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

L + 10 = 2l + 20 \n   L = 2l + 10\n\nWe can now substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:\n\n3l - 10 = 2l + 10\n\nSolving for l, we get:\n\nl = 20\n\nTo find L, we can substitute l = 20 into either equation:\n\nL = 2l + 10 = 50\n\nTherefore, Lucy is 50 years old and Lovely is 20 years old.\n\nThe answer is \"Lucy is 50 years old and Lovely is 20 years old\".\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

We can set up two equations based on the given information: \n\nEquation 1: x + y = 80 (the sum of two numbers is 80)\nEquation 2: x - y = 12 (their difference is 12)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use the method of elimination. Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 eliminates y: \n\nx + y = 80\nx - y = 12\n--------\n2x = 92\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\nx = 46\n\nNow we can use this value of x to solve for y. We can substitute x = 46 into either Equation 1 or Equation 2: \n\nx + y = 80\n46 + y = 80\ny = 34\n\nTherefore, the two numbers are 46 and 34. \n\nThe answer is the two numbers are 46 and 34.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

In this case, the cars are essentially moving away from each other at a rate of (r1 - r2). Therefore, we can use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nto set up the following equation: \n\n140 = (r1 - r2) x (240/60) \n\nSimplifying: \n\n140 = (r1 - r2) x 4 \n\nDividing both sides by 4 to isolate (r1 - r2): \n\n35 = r1 - r2 \n\nStep 2: \nWe now have two equations: \n\n700 = 4(r1 + r2) \n\n35 = r1 - r2 \n\nWe can use substitution to solve for one of the variables. Solving the second equation for r1, we get: \n\nr1 = r2 + 35 \n\nSubstituting this expression for r1 into the first equation, we get: \n\n700 = 4((r2 + 35) + r2) \n\n700 = 8r2 + 140 \n\n560 = 8r2 \n\nr2 = 70 \n\nSubstituting this value for r2 into the equation r1 = r2 + 35, we get: \n\nr1 = 105 \n\nTherefore, the rate of the first car is 105 km/h and the rate of the second car is 70 km/h. \n\nThe answer is \"the rate of the first car is 105 km/h and the rate of the second car is 70 km/h.\"\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

(1/3)(10x + y) = (1/4)(10(x+1) + y) + 1   (since the number is two-digit, we use 10x + y to represent it)\n2. 10x + y = 10x + y    (identity equation)\n\nStep 2: Solving for the number\nFirst, we can simplify equation 1 by multiplying both sides by 12 to get rid of the fractions:\n4(10x + y) = 3(10(x+1) + y) + 12\n40x + 4y = 30x + 30 + 3y + 12\n10x - y = 11\n\nNext, we can substitute equation 2 into this simplified equation:\n10x - (10x + y) = 11\n- y = 11\ny = -11\n\nThis gives us a negative ones digit, which is not possible for a two-digit number, so we made an error somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nFrom equation 2, we know that 10x + y = 10x + y, which simplifies to y = y. This equation doesn't provide us with any additional information, so we need to find another way to approach the problem.\n\nLet's try a different method. We know that the number is two-digit, so x must be between 1 and 9. We also know that one-third of the number is greater than one-fourth of its successor by 1. This means that:\n\n(1/3)(10x + y) > (1/4)(10(x+1) + y) + 1\n4(1/3)(10x + y) > 3(1/4)(10(x+1) + y) + 3\n40x + 4y > 30x + 33\n10x > 33 - 4y\n\nSince x is between 1 and 9, the right-hand side of this equation can be at most 29 (when y is 1). Therefore, we can try each possible value of x and y (with y between 0 and 9) to see if we get a valid solution.\n\nWhen x = 1, we get:\n10 + y > 8 + y + 3\ny > 1\n\nWhen x = 2, we get:\n20 + y > 11 + y + 3\ny > 6\n\nWhen x = 3, we get:\n30 + y > 14 + y + 3\ny > 16/4 = 4\n\nWhen x = 4, we get:\n40 + y > 17 + y + 3\ny > 20/4 = 5\n\nWhen x = 5, we get:\n50 + y > 20 + y + 3\ny > 33/4 = 8.25\n\nWhen x = 6, we get:\n60 + y > 23 + y + 3\ny > 40/4 = 10\n\nWhen x = 7, we get:\n70 + y > 26 + y + 3\ny > 47/4 = 11.75\n\nWhen x = 8, we get:\n80 + y > 29 + y + 3\ny > 56/4 = 14\n\nWhen x = 9, we get:\n90 + y > 32 + y + 3\ny > 61/4 = 15.25\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for y is 16, and the number is 36.\n\nThe answer is the number is 36.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}
