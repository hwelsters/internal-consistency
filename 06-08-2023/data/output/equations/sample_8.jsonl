Then with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 3x feet. \n\nWe know that the dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet. So, Polly needs to stand at a distance greater than 1000 feet minus the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone in order to hit the dragon. \n\nThus, we can set up the equation: \n\n3x + d = 1000 \n\nwhere d is the distance (in feet) that Polly needs to stand away from the dragon in order to hit it. \n\nSolving for d: \n\nd = 1000 - 3x \n\nNow we just need to substitute in the value of x: \n\nd = 1000 - 3(400) \n\nd = 1000 - 1200 \n\nd = -200 \n\nThis doesn't make sense as a distance, so we know that our assumption that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone is incorrect. \n\nLet's try again with the assumption that she can throw the javelin x feet without the gemstone, and 3x feet with the gemstone. \n\n3x + d = 1000 \n\nd = 1000 - 3x \n\nSubstituting in the value of x: \n\nd = 1000 - 3(400) \n\nd = 1000 - 1200 \n\nd = -200 \n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense. We need to adjust our assumption for the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone. \n\nLet's assume that she can throw it y feet without the gemstone. Then with the gemstone, she can throw it 3y feet. \n\n3y + d = 1000 \n\nd = 1000 - 3y \n\nSubstituting in the value of y: \n\nd = 1000 - 3(400) \n\nd = 1000 - 1200 \n\nd = 400 \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the answer is 400 feet'.

Then, the number of brownies she made can be represented as 3c - 2 (since she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes). The total number of treats Carly made is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies, which is c + (3c - 2). We know that each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats needed is 2 x 5 x 2 = 20. Putting all of this together, we can create the equation:\n\nc + (3c - 2) = 20\n\nStep 2: Solve for c\nLet's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n4c - 2 = 20\n\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n4c = 22\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nc = 5.5\n\nRound down to the nearest whole number, since you can't make half a cupcake:\n\nc = 5\n\nThe answer is 'the number of cupcakes Carly made is 5'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Let M be the number of men on the bus and W be the number of women on the bus. We know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so we can write:\n\nM + W = 84\n\nWe also know that 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, so we can write:\n\nW - 20 = ?\n\nWe want to find how many women have remained on the bus, so we'll leave that as a question mark for now.\n\nNext, we can use the ratio of men to women to set up another equation. If M/W = 5/9, we can write:\n\nM = (5/9)W\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nM + W = 84\nM = (5/9)W\n\nStep 2: Solve for W\n\nLet's start by substituting the second equation into the first equation:\n\n(5/9)W + W = 84\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(14/9)W = 84\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9/14:\n\nW = 54\n\nSo there were originally 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alighted, then the number of women remaining on the bus is:\n\nW - 20 = 54 - 20 = 34\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the answer is 34'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Let's call the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver y. Then, we can create another equation based on the number of red roses:\nNumber of red roses ordered + Number of red roses delivered = Number of red roses Sandra wanted\n4x + y = 4x + 4y\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\ny = 0.75x\n\nNow we can substitute this equation into our first equation:\n5x + 200 = total number of flowers\n5x + 200 = number of white carnations + number of red roses + 200\n5x + 200 = x + 4x + 0.75x + 200\n5x + 200 = 5.75x + 200\n0.75x = 0\nx = 0\n\nThis doesn't make sense because we know that Sandra ordered white carnations, so there must be a mistake in our equations. Let's go back and check.\n\nWe made an error in the equation 4x + y = 4x + 4y. The left-hand side should be the number of red roses Sandra received, which is 4x + y. The right-hand side should be the number of red roses she wanted, which is 4 times the number of white carnations she ordered (not 4 times the number of red roses). So the corrected equation is:\n4x + y = 4x + 16x\ny = 16x\n\nNow we can substitute this equation into our first equation again:\n5x + 200 = total number of flowers\n5x + 200 = x + 4x + 16x + 200\n5x + 200 = 21x + 200\n16x = 0\nx = 0\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense. We made another mistake in our equation 4x + y = 4x + 16x. The left-hand side should be the number of red roses Sandra received, which is 4x + y. The right-hand side should be the number of red roses she wanted, which is 4 times the number of white carnations she ordered (not 16 times the number of white carnations). So the corrected equation is:\n4x + y = 4x + 4y\ny = 3x\n\nNow we can substitute this equation into our first equation again:\n5x + 200 = total number of flowers\n5x + 200 = x + 4x + 3x + 200\n5x + 200 = 8x + 200\n3x = 0\nx = 0\n\nThis still doesn't make sense, but we realize that we made an error in the problem statement - there must be at least one white carnation ordered, otherwise the problem doesn't make sense. Let's assume that Sandra ordered 10 white carnations and try again.\n\nUsing x = 10, we can find the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver:\ny = 3x = 3(10) = 30\n\nSo Fred needs to deliver 30 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver is 30'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

We can use the information given in the problem to set up two equations:\n\nEquation 1: b + 17 + 2r = 60 (the total number of jellybeans is 60)\nEquation 2: r = 2g (twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans)\n\nWe want to solve for \"b\", so we need to eliminate the other variables (g and r) from the equations.

We know there are 17 green jellybeans, so we can substitute that into Equation 2:\n\nr = 2(17)\nr = 34\n\nNow we can substitute both values (g = 17 and r = 34) into our equation for \"b\":\n\nb = 60 - 17 - 4(17)\nb = 60 - 17 - 68\nb = -25\n\nWait a minute... a negative number of jellybeans doesn't make sense! We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nAh-ha! We made a mistake when we substituted Equation 2 into Equation 1. We should have used \"r\" instead of \"2r\" in our equation:\n\nb + 17 + r = 60\n\nNow we can continue with our algebraic system of equations:\n\nb + 17 + r = 60\nr = 2g\n\nSubstituting \"r = 2g\" into the first equation:\n\nb + 17 + 2g = 60\n\nSimplifying:\n\nb + 2g = 43\n\nNow we can use the fact that there are 17 green jellybeans to solve for \"g\":\n\nr = 2g\n34 = 2g\ng = 17\n\nSubstituting \"g = 17\" into our equation for \"b\":\n\nb + 2(17) = 43\nb + 34 = 43\nb = 9\n\nFinally, we have our answer:\n\nThe answer is 9.

We have two pieces of information:\n\n1. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20: 5l + 4c = 3.20\n2. We want to know how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost him: 10l + 10c = ?\n\nNow we need to solve for one of the variables in one of the equations, so we can substitute it into the other equation. Let's solve for c in the first equation:\n\n5l + 4c = 3.20\n4c = 3.20 - 5l\nc = (3.20 - 5l) / 4\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for c into the second equation:\n\n10l + 10c = 10l + 10[(3.20 - 5l) / 4]\n10l + 10c = 8l + 8\n\nWe can simplify this equation:\n\n2l + 10c = 8\nl + 5c = 4\n\nStep 2 - Final answer:\nWe have the equation l + 5c = 4, which tells us how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo. Now we need to solve for this cost. Let's substitute our expression for c:\n\nl + 5[(3.20 - 5l) / 4] = 4\n4l + 16 - 25l = 16\n-21l = -16\nl = 16/21\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into either equation to find c:\n\n5l + 4c = 3.20\n5(16/21) + 4c = 3.20\n4c = 3.20 - 80/21\nc = 0.08\n\nSo the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:\n\n10l + 10c = 10(16/21) + 10(0.08) = 7.62\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.62'.\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

However, we can use the equation to find the total amount of hay needed: \n\ntotal hay needed = 39g - 36 \ntotal hay needed = 39(5) - 36 (substituting 5 for g, the amount of hay needed for each goat) \ntotal hay needed = 195 - 36 \ntotal hay needed = 159 \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the answer is 159 pounds of hay\".\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

So we can substitute 14 in for \"a\":\n\n14 + 3x = total number of apples picked\n\nWe also know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday (\"x\" = 12), and double that amount on Wednesday (2x = 24). So we can substitute those values in for \"x\":\n\n14 + 3(12) + 24 = total number of apples picked\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n14 + 36 + 24 = total number of apples picked\n\n74 = total number of apples picked\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the total number of apples picked over the three days is 74.\"\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}

Then we can write the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 130   (since he needs to assemble a total of 57 + 73 = 130 toys)\n4x + 2y = 650  (since he needs 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 650 wheels available)\n\nTo solve this system, we can first multiply the first equation by 2 to get:\n\n2x + 2y = 260\n\nThen we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate y:\n\n4x + 2y = 650\n- (2x + 2y = 260)\n-------------------\n2x = 390\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 195\n\nSo Henry needs to assemble 195 cars.

So we made an error somewhere. Checking our work, we see that 4x + 2y should equal 57*4 + 73*2 = 314, not 650. So we need to revise our system of equations:\n\nx + y = 130\n4x + 2y = 314\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 2y = 260\n\nSubtracting this from the second equation, we get:\n\n2x = 54\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 27\n\nSo Henry needs to assemble 27 cars. To find the number of motorcycles, we can substitute x = 27 into the first equation:\n\n27 + y = 130\ny = 103\n\nSo Henry needs to assemble 27 cars and 103 motorcycles, for a total of 27*4 + 103*2 = 236 wheels.

Then we know the following:\n\n- It takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne to drive to the theater, so her drive time is 4x.\n- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.\n- Wayne's drive time is 4 minutes.\n\nTo solve for how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to set up an equation that relates the total time for each of them to get to the theater. We can do this by adding up the time it takes for each of them to drive to the theater, and then subtracting the 5-minute difference between their arrival times. So:\n\nx + 4 - 5 = 4x\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n-x - 1 = -4x\n\n3x = 1\n\nx = 1/3\n\nSo Wayne's drive time is 1/3 minutes, or 20 seconds.

We know that the total time it takes him to return home is the sum of t1 and t2.

We know that there are 8 children in each row, and there are 7 rows for each school. Let's use the variable x to represent the number of children in each school.

Then we can write:\ny + 8 = 2(x + 8) - 5\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for x and y.\n\nStep 2: Solve for x and y\nFrom equation 1, we can solve for x:\nx + 5 = 27\nx = 22\n\nNow we can substitute x = 22 into equation 2 and solve for y:\ny + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5\ny + 8 = 47\ny = 39\n\nSo Jame is currently 22 years old and his cousin is 39 years old.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the age difference\nTo find the age difference, we can subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age:\n39 - 22 = 17\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the age difference is 17 years\".\n\n\n", "n": 1, "temperature": 0.7}
