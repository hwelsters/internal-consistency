However, the question doesn't specify this. \n\nLet's try again, but this time assuming that Car A and Car B are travelling in opposite directions. \n\nLet d be the distance from the starting point that Car A travels before Car B catches up to it. \nLet t be the time it takes for Car B to catch up to Car A. \n\nAgain, we know that Car A travels a distance of 45 km\/h x 3 h = 135 km before Car B starts. \n\nWhen Car B catches up to Car A, the total distance travelled by both cars is d + 135 km. \n\nCar A travels at 45 km\/h and Car B travels at 55 km\/h. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: \n\n45 km\/h x (t + 3 h) = 55 km\/h x t + d + 135 km\n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n45t + 135 = 55t + d + 135\n-10t = d\nt = -d\/10\n\nThis equation tells us that Car B catches up to Car A after a time of -d\/10. However, time cannot be negative, so we know that d must be negative as well. This means that Car B catches up to Car A before Car A has travelled a distance of 135 km. \n\nTo find the distance that Car B travels before catching up to Car A, we can use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nCar B travels for a time of t hours at a rate of 55 km\/h, so the distance it travels is: \n\ndistance = 55 km\/h x t = -5.5d \n\nWe know that Car A travels a distance of 135 km before Car B catches up to it, so: \n\n-d + 135 = -5.5d \n4.5d = 135 \nd = 30 \n\nTherefore, Car B catches up to Car A after Car A has travelled a distance of 30 km. \n\nStep 2: \nThe answer is: Car B catches up to Car A after 3 + (30\/55) hours.

So the amount of work is the capacity of the tank. Let's call that \"W\".\n\nWe know that the tank can be filled in 2 hours, so the rate at which it fills is:\n\nF = W \/ 2\n\nSimilarly, the tank can be emptied in 6 hours, so the rate at which it empties is:\n\nE = W \/ 6\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the faucet is on and the drain is left open. In this case, the effective rate at which the tank is filling up is:\n\nF - E = W \/ 2 - W \/ 6 = W \/ 3\n\nSo the time it will take for the tank to fill up and overflow is:\n\ntime = amount of work \/ rate = W \/ (W \/ 3) = 3 hours\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the tank will overflow in 3 hours\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{d: f\/2, e: f\/6, a: b*c}","flag":"FREE"}

Then, the price he paid for the first car would be \"x - 2600\". \n\nNext, we can use the information about the profits to set up two equations: \n\nProfit from first car = 35% of (x-2600) \nProfit from second car = 15% of x \n\nWe can simplify these equations: \n\nProfit from first car = 0.35(x-2600) \nProfit from second car = 0.15x \n\nFinally, we know that the total profit was $2640, so we can set up one more equation: \n\nTotal profit = profit from first car + profit from second car \n2640 = 0.35(x-2600) + 0.15x \n\nNow we can solve for x: \n\n2640 = 0.35x - 910 + 0.15x \n3850 = 0.5x \nx = 7700 \n\nSo Michael paid $7700 for the second car. That means he paid $5100 for the first car ($7700 - $2600). \n\nTo find the selling price of each car, we just need to calculate the profits and add them to the original prices: \n\nSelling price of first car = $5100 + 0.35($5100) = $6895 \nSelling price of second car = $7700 + 0.15($7700) = $8855 \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the selling price of the first car is $6895 and the selling price of the second car is $8855'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"{a: 7100.00000000000, b: 4500.00000000000, e: 1065.00000000000, f: 1575.00000000000, g: 7100.00000000000, d: 6885.00000000000, c: 8855.00000000000}","flag":"OK"}
