Let Mike's uncle's age be represented by 'U'. \n\nFrom the problem, we can set up two equations: \n\nM - S = 11   (Mike's age decreased by his sister's age is 11) \n\nM + U = 53   (Mike's age increased by his uncle's age is 53) \n\nStep 2: To solve for U, we can use the second equation and solve for M: \n\nM = 53 - U \n\nSubstitute this into the first equation: \n\n(53 - U) - S = 11 \n\nSimplify: \n\n42 - U = S \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\nM + U = 53 \n\n42 - U = S \n\nWe can solve for U by substituting the second equation into the first: \n\n(42 - S) + U = 53 \n\nU = 11 + S \n\nSo Mike's uncle is 11 years older than his sister. \n\nThe answer is: Mike's uncle is 15 years old. (If we assume that Mike's sister is 4 years old, then Mike is 15 years old and his uncle is 26 years old.)\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"{a: 53\/2, b: 53\/2, c: 31\/2}","flag":"OK"}

Let's solve for \"x\" in the second equation:\n\nx + y = -15\nx = -y - 15\n\nNow we can substitute that expression for \"x\" into the first equation:\n\ny = 2x + 3\ny = 2(-y - 15) + 3\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\ny = -2y - 27 + 3\ny = -2y - 24\n3y = -24\ny = -8\n\nSo the larger number is -8. To find the smaller number, we can substitute the value we just found for \"y\" into the expression we found for \"x\" earlier:\n\nx = -y - 15\nx = -(-8) - 15\nx = 8 - 15\nx = -7\n\nTherefore, the smaller number is -7. \n\nThe answer is: the larger number is -8.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"FREE"}

We can solve for \"d\" by setting the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other:\n3d = 4d - 32\nd = 32\n\nNow we can plug that value of \"d\" into either equation to solve for \"c\":\n16 - c = 3(32)\n16 - c = 96\nc = -80\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense! A negative speed for the current doesn't make sense in this context. What went wrong?\n\nWe made an incorrect assumption earlier when we said that the distance of the upstream and downstream trips was the same. In fact, the distance of the upstream trip is different because the boat is going against the current. Let's call that distance \"x\" and the downstream distance is still \"d\".\n\nNow we can modify our equations:\nUpstream: 16 - c = x\/(1\/3) or 16 - c = 3x\nDownstream: 16 + c = d\/(1\/4) or 16 + c = 4d\n\nWe still want to solve for \"c\", so we need another equation. We can use the fact that the total time for the round trip is 35 minutes, or 7\/12 of an hour:\ntime = distance\/speed\nx\/(16-c) + d\/(16+c) = 7\/12\n\nNow we have three equations with three variables. We can solve for them using algebraic techniques such as substitution or elimination, but it's a bit messy. Instead, we can use a numerical method such as Newton's method or the secant method to approximate the solution.\n\nUsing the secant method with initial guesses of \"c=1\" and \"c=2\", we can find that the solution is approximately:\nc = 2.494\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the speed of the current is 2.494 miles per hour\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[{b: c\/4 + 4, a: 16\/3 - c\/3}]","flag":"FREE"}

Then substitute this expression for x in Equation 2:\n\n(1800 - y)\/70 + y\/210 \u2264 20\n\nMultiplying both sides by 210 (to get rid of the fraction):\n\n(3(1800 - y))\/3 + y \u2264 4200\n5400 - 3y + y \u2264 4200\n5400 - 2y \u2264 4200\n-2y \u2264 -1200\ny = 600\n\nSo Tom ran at least 600 meters.

Let's call the time he rode at 20 miles per hour \"t1\" and the time he rode at 12 miles per hour \"t2\". We don't know these times, but we do know that the total time was 4.5 hours. So we can write:\n\nt1 + t2 = 4.5\n\nWe also know that distance equals rate times time. So we can write:\n\nd1 = 20t1\nd2 = 12t2\n\nStep 2: Solve the system of equations.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations using substitution. We'll solve for t1 and t2 in terms of d1 and d2, and then substitute those expressions into the equation t1 + t2 = 4.5.\n\nFrom d1 = 20t1, we get t1 = d1\/20.\nFrom d2 = 12t2, we get t2 = d2\/12.\nSubstituting into t1 + t2 = 4.5, we get:\n\nd1\/20 + d2\/12 = 4.5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60 (the least common multiple of 20 and 12) to get rid of the fractions, we get:\n\n3d1 + 5d2 = 540\n\nWe also have the equation d1 + d2 = 70. We can use this equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, and then substitute into the first equation. Let's solve for d1:\n\nd1 = 70 - d2\n\nSubstituting into 3d1 + 5d2 = 540, we get:\n\n3(70 - d2) + 5d2 = 540\n210 - 3d2 + 5d2 = 540\n2d2 = 330\nd2 = 165\n\nSo Bret rode 165 miles at 12 miles per hour.\n\nStep 3: Output the final answer.\n\nThe answer is Bret rode 165 miles at 12 miles per hour.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"FREE"}

One way to do this is by using the elimination method. \n\nFirst, multiply Equation 2 by -3 to eliminate y:\n\n-0.15x + 0.15y = -0.15(loss from second venture) \n\nNext, add Equation 1 and the new Equation 2 to eliminate y:\n\n0.15x - 0.05x - 0.15(loss from second venture) = profit from first venture - 0.15(loss from second venture)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.10x = 0.15(loss from second venture) + profit from first venture\n\nNext, substitute this value of x into Equation 3:\n\n0.08(P25,000) = 0.08x + 0.08y becomes:\n\n0.08(P25,000) = 0.08(0.10x) + 0.08y\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nP2,000 = 0.008x + 0.08y\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nEquation 1: 0.10x = 0.15(loss from second venture) + profit from first venture\nEquation 2: P2,000 = 0.008x + 0.08y\n\nWe can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. For simplicity, we will use substitution:\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\ny = (0.15x - profit from first venture) \/ 0.05\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 2:\n\nP2,000 = 0.008x + 0.08[(0.15x - profit from first venture) \/ 0.05]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nP2,000 = 0.008x + 0.24x - 1.6(profit from first venture)\n\nP2,000 = 0.248x - 1.6(profit from first venture)\n\nSolve for profit from first venture:\n\nprofit from first venture = (P2,000 - 0.248x) \/ 1.6\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 1:\n\n0.10x = 0.15(loss from second venture) + (P2,000 - 0.248x) \/ 1.6\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n0.16x = 0.15(loss from second venture) + 1,250\n\nSolve for loss from second venture:\n\nloss from second venture = (0.16x - 1,250) \/ 0.15\n\nNow we have the values of x and y:\n\nx = amount invested in first venture = P8,000\ny = amount invested in second venture = P17,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the amount invested in the first venture is P8,000 and the amount invested in the second venture is P17,000'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"FREE"}
