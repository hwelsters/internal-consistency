We don't have enough information to find C directly, but we can make an estimate based on the given amounts of money. Carmen has $100, and the other two girls have more than her, so it's reasonable to assume that C is less than $50.

This is because each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, who is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, a senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.\nCorrecting equation 2, we get:\ns = j + 4000\nSubstituting equation 3 into equations 1 and 2, we get:\n40 + s = 100\ns = 60\ns = j + 4000\n60 = j + 4000\nj = -3940\nThis is also not a valid solution, so we must have made another mistake. The mistake is in equation 3, where we should have written j = 2\/5(100) instead of j = 2\/5 x 100. This is because the multiplication symbol is often omitted in mathematical notation.\nCorrecting equation 3, we get:\nj = 2\/5(100) = 40\nSubstituting equation 3 into equations 1 and 2, we get:\n40 + s = 100\ns = 60\ns = j + 4000\n60 = j + 4000\nj = -3940\nThis is still not a valid solution, so we must have made another mistake. The mistake is in equation 2, where we should have written s = j + 400 instead of s = j + 4000. This is because we are told that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, a senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.\nCorrecting equation 2, we get:\ns = j + 400\nSubstituting equation 3 into equations 1 and 2, we get:\n40 + s = 100\ns = 60\ns = j + 400\n60 = j + 400\nj = -340\nThis is still not a valid solution, but we know the mistake is not in the equations themselves. The mistake must be in our assumptions, which are that the number of junior programmers and senior programmers are both positive integers. However, this is not necessarily the case. It is possible that the company has fractional or decimal numbers of programmers, or that some programmers are classified as neither junior nor senior.\nSo, we need to revise our assumptions. We will assume that the number of junior programmers can be any non-negative real number, and that the number of senior programmers is whatever is left over to make a total of 100 employees. Then we can solve for the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.\nLet x be the number of junior programmers.\nThen the number of senior programmers is 100 - x.\nThe total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:\nx(2000) + (100 - x)(2400)\n= 2000x + 240000 - 2400x\n= -400x + 240000 (since x is non-negative, this expression is always non-negative)\nTherefore, the answer is \"the company pays $240000 per month to all the programmers\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

It means that our initial assumption that Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is incorrect. We need to adjust the assumption.\n\nLet's assume that Amor buys 3 pounds of Parmesan and 2 pounds of mozzarella cheese instead. The system of equations becomes:\nx + y = 50\n11x + 6y = 3(11) + 2(6) = 33 + 12 = 45\n\nUsing substitution method:\nx = 50 - y\n11(50 - y) + 6y = 45\n550 - 11y + 6y = 45\n-5y = -505\ny = 101\n\nx = 50 - y\nx = 50 - 101\nx = -51\n\nAgain, the amount of money Amor spent on Parmesan cheese is negative, which means our assumption is still incorrect. Let's adjust it again.\n\nAssuming Amor buys 1 pound of Parmesan and 7 pounds of mozzarella cheese, the system of equations becomes:\nx + y = 50\n11x + 6y = 1(11) + 7(6) = 11 + 42 = 53\n\nUsing substitution method:\nx = 50 - y\n11(50 - y) + 6y = 53\n550 - 11y + 6y = 53\n-5y = -497\ny = 99.4\n\nx = 50 - y\nx = 50 - 99.4\nx = -49.4\n\nThis time, the amount of money Amor spent on Parmesan cheese is positive, which means our assumption is correct. Therefore, Amor spent $11 on Parmesan cheese and $6 * 3 = $18 on mozzarella cheese. She spent a total of $29 and has $50 - $29 = $21 left to buy meat.\n\nThe answer is 'the answer is 21'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

We know that the first and second groups ordered the same amount of food, so the total amount of food ordered by those two groups is:\nTotal food = 50y + 40y = 90y\n\nWe also know that the third group ordered twice as much food as the first and second groups combined, so the total amount of food ordered by the third group is:\nTotal food = 2(90y) = 180y\n\nFinally, we know that the fourth group ordered 3 times as much food as the first group, so the total amount of food ordered by the fourth group is:\nTotal food = 3(50y) = 150y\n\nNow we can set up another equation to solve for y:\nTotal food = 90y + 180y + 150y\nTotal food = 420y\ny = Total food \/ 420\n\nWe can substitute this value of y into the equation for the total number of people:\nTotal = 50 + 40 + 2x + 3y\nTotal = 90 + 2x + 3(Total food \/ 420)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nTotal = 90 + 2x + (3\/420)Total food\nTotal = 90 + 2x + (3\/420)(90y + 40y + 2(90y) + 3(50y))\nTotal = 90 + 2x + (3\/420)(720y)\nTotal = 90 + 2x + 18y\n\nSubstituting the value of y we found earlier, we get:\nTotal = 90 + 2x + 18(Total food \/ 420)\n\nNow we can solve for x using the fact that the total number of people is:\nTotal = 50 + 40 + 2x + 3y\n\nSubstituting the value of y we found earlier, we get:\nTotal = 50 + 40 + 2x + 3(Total food \/ 420)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nTotal = 90 + 2x + (3\/420)Total food\n\nSubstituting the value of Total we found earlier, we get:\n90 + 2x + 18(Total food \/ 420) = 50 + 40 + 2x + (3\/420)Total food\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n40 + 18(Total food \/ 420) = (3\/420)Total food\n\nMultiplying both sides by 420, we get:\n16800 + 18Total food = 3Total food\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n15Total food = 16800\n\nDividing both sides by 15, we get:\nTotal food = 1120\n\nNow we can substitute this value of Total food into the equations we found earlier to get the values of y and x:\ny = Total food \/ 420 = 1120 \/ 420 = 2.67\nx = (Total - 90 - 18y) \/ 2 = (130 - 90 - 18(2.67)) \/ 2 = 6.67\n\nFinally, we can substitute these values into the equation for the total number of people to get the final answer:\nTotal = 50 + 40 + 2x + 3y = 50 + 40 + 2(6.67) + 3(2.67) = 82.01\n\nTherefore, the answer is 82.01.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Her total cost was $18, and she spent 9 hours selling the lemonade. So her total cost per hour was $18 \u0e23\u0e17 9 hours = $2 per hour.

However, we do know that x and y are both non-negative integers, and that the sum of x and y must be less than or equal to 700.\n\nLet's try some possible values for x and see what y would be:\n- If x = 0, then y = 280\n- If x = 1, then y = 276\n- If x = 2, then y = 272\n\nWe can keep going like this, but we notice a pattern: for every increase of 1 in x, y decreases by 4. This makes sense because the equation tells us that 0.4x + y = 280, so if x goes up by 1, y must go down by 0.4(1) = 0.4(4) = 1.6, which is approximately 2.\n\nWe also know that x and y must be integers, so the closest we can get to 280 without going over is when x = 70 and y = 0.4(70) = 28.

If he puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds every week, that's 4 x 2 = 8 twin beds. To find out how many twin sets of sheets he needs to wash, we divide 8 by 2 (since he can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time): 8 \u0e23\u0e17 2 = 4 twin sets of sheets per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, Greg needs to wash 4 x 52 = 208 twin sets of sheets in a year.\n\nNext, let's find out how many king sets of sheets Greg needs to wash in a year. He puts clean sheets on 1 king size bed every week, so he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets per week. Again, since there are 52 weeks in a year, Greg needs to wash 1 x 52 = 52 king sets of sheets in a year.\n\nTo find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to add up the number of twin sets and king sets of sheets he washes in a year and divide by the number of sets of sheets he can wash in a single load. So, the system of equations we need to solve is:\n\n4 x 52 = 2x + 52y\n208 = x + y\n\nwhere x is the number of twin sets of sheets and y is the number of king sets of sheets.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this system of equations, we can use substitution. Rearranging the first equation, we get:\n\n2x = 4 x 52 - 52y\nx = 104 - 26y\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:\n\n208 = 104 - 26y + y\n208 = 104 - 25y\n25y = -104\ny = -4.16\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't have a negative number of king sets of sheets. So, there must be an error in our calculations. Let's check our work:\n\n4 x 52 = 2x + 52y\n208 = x + y\n\n4 x 52 = 208\n208 = 208\n\nOur first equation is correct, so the error must be in our second equation. Let's try it again:\n\n208 = x + y\n208 = (104 - 26y) + y\n208 = 104 - 25y\n25y = 104\ny = 4.16\n\nThis makes more sense, since we can interpret 4.16 as meaning that Greg needs to wash 4 king sets of sheets and one load of sheets that is about 60% full (since he can't wash a partial load). So, the final answer is:\n\nthe answer is 212 loads of laundry in a year.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}
