Substituting y = 4 into the first equation:\n2x + 12(4) = 26\n2x + 48 = 26\n2x = -22\nx = -11\n\nBut this answer doesn't make sense - we can't sell negative sunflowers. What went wrong? \n\nLooking back at our equations, we see that we assumed the revenue from the bouquets was 8y, but this is only true if each bouquet is sold for the full price of $8. However, if we sold 4 bouquets but didn't sell all the individual sunflowers, some of those sunflowers were likely sold at a discount as part of a bouquet. \n\nLet's try a different approach. If each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, and we sold 4 bouquets, then we sold a total of 48 sunflowers as part of bouquets. We don't know how many individual sunflowers were sold, but we know that the total revenue from all sunflowers was $26, so:\n\n2x + 8(4) = 26\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nSo Faraday sold 5 individual sunflowers over the course of 3 days. Adding in the 48 sunflowers sold as part of bouquets, the total number of sunflowers sold is:\n\n5 + 48 = 53\n\nTherefore, Faraday sold 53 sunflowers over the course of 3 days. \n\nThe answer is: Faraday was able to sell 53 sunflowers after 3 days.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"SUS"}

We can test values of x to see which one gives the largest total amount: \n\nIf x = 0, then y = 12 and the total amount = 5(0) + 7(12) = 84. \nIf x = 1, then y = 11 and the total amount = 5(1) + 7(11) = 82. \nIf x = 2, then y = 10 and the total amount = 5(2) + 7(10) = 80. \nIf x = 3, then y = 9 and the total amount = 5(3) + 7(9) = 78. \nIf x = 4, then y = 8 and the total amount = 5(4) + 7(8) = 76. \nIf x = 5, then y = 7 and the total amount = 5(5) + 7(7) = 75. \nIf x = 6, then y = 6 and the total amount = 5(6) + 7(6) = 72. \nIf x = 7, then y = 5 and the total amount = 5(7) + 7(5) = 69. \nIf x = 8, then y = 4 and the total amount = 5(8) + 7(4) = 68. \nIf x = 9, then y = 3 and the total amount = 5(9) + 7(3) = 67. \nIf x = 10, then y = 2 and the total amount = 5(10) + 7(2) = 64. \nIf x = 11, then y = 1 and the total amount = 5(11) + 7(1) = 61. \nIf x = 12, then y = 0 and the total amount = 5(12) + 7(0) = 60. \n\nSo the largest total amount is 84, which happens when Matthew sells all the toy soldiers in the second half for $7 each. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \"the answer is $84\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{a: 84 - 2*c, b: 12 - c}","flag":"SUS"}

This means that the funding for month 6 would be 1.5x, the funding for month 7 would be 1.5(1.5x) = 2.25x, and so on. We can use this information to create another equation: \n\ny(z\/2)x = total funding for the remaining months \n\nFinally, we know that John's research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so: \n\ny = 10 \n\nPutting it all together, we have the system of equations: \n\n5x = 100,000 \n10(z\/2)x = total funding for the remaining months \n\nStep 2: Final Answer\nWe can solve for x by rearranging the first equation: \n\nx = 20,000 \n\nSubstituting x into the second equation: \n\n10(z\/2)(20,000) = total funding for the remaining months \n5z(20,000) = total funding for the remaining months \n100,000z = total funding for the remaining months \n\nTo find the total cost of John's research, we add the initial funding to the funding for the remaining months: \n\ntotal cost = $100,000 + $100,000z \ntotal cost = $100,000 + $100,000(z\/1) \n\nWe don't have enough information to solve for z, so we can't get an exact answer. However, we can estimate the total cost based on different values of z: \n\n- If z = 0 (no increase in funding), the total cost would be $100,000. \n- If z = 0.5 (50% increase in funding per month after the first 5 months), the total cost would be $150,000. \n- If z = 1 (100% increase in funding per month after the first 5 months), the total cost would be $200,000. \n\nSo, the answer is: the total cost of John's research is estimated to be between $100,000 and $200,000, depending on the amount of increase in funding per month after the first 5 months.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[{d: 20000, a: 100000*e, b: 100*c*(e + 1)}]","flag":"SUS"}

If the original weight of the redwood tree is W, then:\n\nAmount of wood left = 0.7W\n\nNow we need to figure out how much each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs. We know that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so we can set up the equation:\n\nWeight of each 10-foot section = 400\n\nFinally, we need to figure out how many 10-foot sections are in the entire redwood tree. If the height of the redwood tree is H, then:\n\nNumber of 10-foot sections = H\/10\n\nStep 2: Final Answer\nNow that we have all the equations we need, we can put them together to find the weight of the redwood tree. We know that the weight of each 10-foot section is 400 pounds, and there are H\/10 sections in the entire tree. However, we need to adjust this equation to account for the fact that the termites ate 30% of the wood:\n\nWeight of redwood tree = (0.7W) * (H\/10) * 400\n\nWe don't know the original weight of the redwood tree, but we do know that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Since there are 20 sections in the first 200 feet of the tree, we can assume that the entire tree has 20 sections for every additional 10 feet of height. Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections in the entire tree is:\n\nNumber of 10-foot sections = 20 + (H-200)\/10\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nWeight of redwood tree = (0.7 * 400 * (20 + (H-200)\/10) * H)\/10\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nWeight of redwood tree = 28 * H^2 - 2800 * H + 56000\n\nNow we just need to plug in H = 200 (since the tree is 200 feet tall) and solve:\n\nWeight of redwood tree = 28 * 200^2 - 2800 * 200 + 56000 = 2,240,000 pounds\n\nThe answer is 2,240,000 pounds.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{b: 0.7*I, c: e + 400.0, a: 5.71311977147521 + 565.598857376046*I, d: f - 2.01999591920016 + 0.02040399918384*I, g: 2.8565598857376 + 282.799428688023*I, i: 20.1999591920016 - 0.2040399918384*I}","flag":"SUS"}

Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 1 piece every 2 hours for 4 times. Therefore, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school hours.\n- On the way home from school: Jim chews 1 piece of gum.\n- After dinner: Jim chews 1 piece of gum.\n- Before bed: Jim gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister. Therefore, he has half of the gum he had before dinner.\n\nLet's represent the number of pieces of gum Jim has at different times as variables:\n\n- Let x be the number of pieces of gum Jim starts with.\n- After school hours: Jim has x - 4 pieces of gum left.\n- After the way home from school: Jim has x - 4 - 1 = x - 5 pieces of gum left.\n- After dinner: Jim has x - 6 pieces of gum left.\n- Before bed: Jim gives half of x - 6 pieces of gum to his sister. Therefore, Jim has (x - 6) \/ 2 pieces of gum left.\n\nTo find the final answer, we need to solve for (x - 6) \/ 2 = number of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\nx - 6 = 2 * (number of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day)\n\nAdding 6 to both sides, we get:\nx = 2 * (number of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day) + 6\n\nSince we know that Jim starts with a 20 pack of gum, we can substitute x = 20 into the equation above and solve for the number of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day:\n20 = 2 * (number of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day) + 6\n14 = 2 * (number of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day)\nnumber of gum pieces Jim has left at the end of the day = 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"{a: 15, b: 7, c: 16, d: 14, e: 7, f: 20}","flag":"OK"}

Let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet \"d\".

Lauren is saving 20% of her paycheck, so she is keeping 80% of her salary. \n2. She plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. \n3. She will live with 40% of her current annual salary, which means she will need to save enough to cover 60% of her current salary. \n4. Her current salary is $100,000. \n\nLet's use the variable x to represent the amount of money Lauren saves from every paycheck. \n\nFrom step 1, we know that Lauren is keeping 80% of her salary, so she is saving 20%. \n\n0.20x = amount saved from every paycheck \n\nFrom step 2, we know that Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. \n\n20 = number of years she plans to save \n\nFrom step 3, we know that Lauren will live with 40% of her current annual salary, which means she will need to save enough to cover 60% of her current salary. \n\n0.60($100,000) = amount needed to cover 60% of her current salary \n\nFrom step 4, we know that Lauren's current salary is $100,000. \n\n$100,000 = current salary \n\nNow we can put these equations together: \n\n0.20x * 12 * 20 = 0.60($100,000) * 20\n\nStep 2: Final answer\n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n0.20x * 12 * 20 = 0.60($100,000) * 20\n0.20x * 240 = $1,200,000\nx = $50,000\n\nLauren saves $50,000 from every paycheck. \n\nTo find how many more years she needs to work, we can use the equation: \n\n20 - current age = number of years she needs to work\n\nAssuming Lauren is 25 years old, she needs to work: \n\n20 - 25 = -5\n\nThis means Lauren has already saved enough to retire and does not need to work anymore. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Lauren does not need to work anymore.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE{c: 0.2*I, b: 20.0000000000000, d: 240.0*I\/e, f: 4.0*I, i: 0.04*I, j: 2.0*I, h: 48.0*I, a: 20.0 - g}","flag":"SUS"}

There are 180 minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, which means Vince had 12 intervals to staple reports. Let's use the variable x to represent the number of reports Vince staples in one 15-minute interval. Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\n30 reports \/ 15 minutes = x reports \/ 1 interval\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2 reports\/minute = x reports\/interval\n\nNext, we can use this equation to find out how many reports Vince staples in all 12 intervals:\n\n12 intervals x (2 reports\/minute) = 24 reports\n\nTherefore, Vince staples 24 reports in the 3-hour time period from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM.\n\nTo find out how many reports Vince staples altogether, we can use the following equation:\n\nTotal reports = reports per interval x number of intervals\n\nLet's use the variable y to represent the total number of reports Vince staples. Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\ny = x * n\n\nwhere x = 24 reports (from above) and n = number of 15-minute intervals in 15 hours.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 240 minutes in 4 hours. Therefore, there are 16 intervals in 4 hours. Since Vince was stapling reports for 15 hours (from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM), he had 15 x 4 = 60 intervals to staple reports in. Therefore, we can write:\n\nn = 60 intervals\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\ny = 24 reports\/interval * 60 intervals\ny = 1440 reports\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nThe answer is 1440 reports.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[{a: 0, b: 0, c: 0, f: 0, h: 0}, {a: h\/(60*g), b: h**2\/(43200*e*g), c: h\/1440, d: h\/(60*g), f: h\/g}]","flag":"SUS"}

Then we can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:\n\n1. Zaid spends 1\/4 of his salary on rent:\n1\/4x = rent\n\n2. Zaid spends 1\/3 of his salary on car fuel:\n1\/3x = fuel\n\n3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 = charity\n\n4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 - 200 = daughter\n\n5. Zaid gives his wife 700$ to budget for groceries and other household goods:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 - 200 - 700 = wife\n\nWe want to find out how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations, so we need to solve for x.\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nLet's solve the system of equations:\n\n1. 1\/4x = rent\nx = 4 * rent\n\n2. 1\/3x = fuel\nx = 3 * fuel\n\n3. (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 = charity\nx = 24 * charity\n\n4. (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 - 200 = daughter\nx = 24 * daughter + 2400\n\n5. (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 - 200 - 700 = wife\nx = 24 * wife + 3100\n\nNow we can substitute x in equation 5 with the expression we got from equation 3:\n\n24 * charity = (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2\n48 * charity = (6\/12 - 3\/12 - 4\/12)x\n48 * charity = (-1\/12)x\nx = -576 * charity\n\nSubstituting this expression for x in equation 4, we get:\n\n-576 * charity = 24 * daughter + 2400\n-24 * charity = daughter + 4.17\n\nSubstituting this expression for daughter in equation 5, we get:\n\n-576 * charity = 24 * wife + 3100\n-24 * charity = wife + 5.39\n\nNow we can solve for charity:\n\n-24 * charity = (-1\/2)x + 200 + 700\n-24 * charity = (-1\/2) * 6000 + 900\n-24 * charity = 2100\ncharity = -87.5\n\nThis doesn't make sense because charity should be a positive number. We made a mistake somewhere along the way. Let's check our equations:\n\n1. Zaid spends 1\/4 of his salary on rent:\n1\/4x = rent\n\n2. Zaid spends 1\/3 of his salary on car fuel:\n1\/3x = fuel\n\n3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 = charity\n\n4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 - 200 = daughter\n\n5. Zaid gives his wife 700$ to budget for groceries and other household goods:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3)x * 1\/2 - 200 - 700 = wife\n\nAh, we made a mistake in equation 3. We should have subtracted 1\/4x and 1\/3x from 1 instead of from x. Let's fix that:\n\n3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x * 1\/2 = charity\n\nNow let's solve the system of equations again:\n\n1. 1\/4x = rent\nx = 4 * rent\n\n2. 1\/3x = fuel\nx = 3 * fuel\n\n3. (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x * 1\/2 = charity\nx = 12 * charity\n\n4. (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x * 1\/2 - 200 = daughter\nx = 12 * daughter + 2400\n\n5. (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x * 1\/2 - 200 - 700 = wife\nx = 12 * wife + 3100\n\nNow we can substitute x in equation 5 with the expression we got from equation 3:\n\n12 * charity = (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x * 1\/2\n24 * charity = (6\/12 - 3\/12 - 4\/12)x\n24 * charity = (-1\/12)x\nx = -288 * charity\n\nSubstituting this expression for x in equation 4, we get:\n\n-288 * charity = 12 * daughter + 2400\n-24 * charity = daughter + 8.33\n\nSubstituting this expression for daughter in equation 5, we get:\n\n-288 * charity = 12 * wife + 3100\n-24 * charity = wife + 10.76\n\nNow we can solve for charity:\n\n-24 * charity = (-1\/2)x + 200 + 700\n-24 * charity = (-1\/2) * 6000 + 900\n-24 * charity = 2100\ncharity = -87.5\n\nThis still doesn't make sense.

Zaid gives his wife 700$ to budget for groceries and other household goods:\n(1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x * 1\/2 - 200 - 700 = wife\n\nAh, we made another mistake in equation 3. We should have multiplied by 1\/2 before subtracting 1\/4x and 1\/3x. Let's fix that:\n\n3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:\n1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x = charity\n\nNow let's solve the system of equations again:\n\n1. 1\/4x = rent\nx = 4 * rent\n\n2. 1\/3x = fuel\nx = 3 * fuel\n\n3. 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x = charity\nx = 24 * charity\n\n4. 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x - 200 = daughter\nx = 24 * daughter + 4800\n\n5. 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x - 200 - 700 = wife\nx = 24 * wife + 5500\n\nNow we can substitute x in equation 5 with the expression we got from equation 3:\n\n24 * charity = 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x\n48 * charity = 1\/6x\nx = 288 * charity\n\nSubstituting this expression for x in equation 4, we get:\n\n288 * charity = 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x - 200\n24 * charity = daughter + 8.33\n\nSubstituting this expression for daughter in equation 5, we get:\n\n288 * charity = 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * x - 200 - 700\n24 * charity = wife + 14.58\n\nNow we can solve for charity:\n\n24 * charity = 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * 6000\n24 * charity = 550\ncharity = 22.92\n\nNow we can substitute this value for charity in our expressions for daughter, wife, and x:\n\n24 * daughter + 4800 = 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * 6000 - 200\n24 * daughter = 682.67\ndaughter = 28.44\n\n24 * wife + 5500 = 1\/2 * (1 - 1\/4 - 1\/3) * 6000 - 200 - 700\n24 * wife = 1297.67\nwife = 54.07\n\nx = 24 * charity = 550.00\n\nNow we can find out how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations:\n\nZaid's salary is 6000$ per month. He spends 1\/4 on rent, 1\/3 on car fuel, donates 22.92$, gives his daughter 28.44$ and his wife 54.07$. We can find out how much he has left by subtracting these expenses from his salary:\n\n6000 * 3\/4 * 2\/3 - 22.92 - 28.44 - 54.07 = 2832.50\n\nSo the answer is 'the answer is 2832.50'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"SUS"}
