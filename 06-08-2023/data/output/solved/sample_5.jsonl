This means that the amount of water in the remaining orange drink is (2\/3)(9) = 6 liters. \n\nSimilarly, let y be the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink (in liters). Then, we know that the amount of water in the pineapple drink is (3\/5)(15) = 9 liters. \n\nWhen we mix the two drinks together, we get a total of 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters of drink. The total amount of water in the mixture is x + y + 6 + 9. We want to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, so we need to solve for x + y. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that the overall water content of the mixture is (x + y + 6 + 9)\/24. We also know that the water content of the orange drink is x\/(10 - 1) = x\/9, and the water content of the pineapple drink is y\/15.

We know that she makes 3\/4 times as many pounds of chocolate in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, if we let x be the number of pounds of chocolate Ruiz makes in two hours, Marissa makes 3\/4*x pounds of chocolate in an hour. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolate they make together in one hour. We can just add up the pounds of chocolate they make in an hour: \n\nTotal pounds of chocolate made in an hour = Ruiz's pounds of chocolate in two hours + Marissa's pounds of chocolate in an hour\nTotal pounds of chocolate made in an hour = x + 3\/4*x\nTotal pounds of chocolate made in an hour = 7\/4*x\n\nWe know that they work for 12 hours in a day. So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they make together in a day would be:\n\nTotal amount of chocolate pounds made in a day = Total pounds of chocolate made in an hour * Number of hours they work\nTotal amount of chocolate pounds made in a day = 7\/4*x * 12\nTotal amount of chocolate pounds made in a day = 21\/2*x\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nWe know that Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours. So, x = 120. \n\nTotal amount of chocolate pounds made in a day = 21\/2*120\nTotal amount of chocolate pounds made in a day = 1260\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

So, he will have a total of 8 clients. \n\nEach client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. \n\nThe cost of each bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of each pack of cloths is $5. \n\nKim's total income each week will be $92. \n\nLet's use the variables b and c to represent the number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need each week. \n\nUsing this information, we can create an algebraic system of equations: \n\n3b + 3c + 5b + 5c = 92 \n\nb = 2c \n\nStep 2: \n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations. \n\nSubstitute b = 2c into the first equation: \n\n3(2c) + 3c + 5(2c) + 5c = 92 \n\nSimplify: \n\n16c = 92 \n\nc = 5.75 \n\nSubstitute c = 5.75 into the equation b = 2c: \n\nb = 2(5.75) \n\nb = 11.5 \n\nSo, Kim will need 11.5 bottles of bleach and 5.75 packs of cloths each week. Since he can't buy a half bottle of bleach, let's round up to 12 bottles of bleach and 6 packs of cloths. \n\nHis total expenses will be: \n\n12 bottles of bleach x $2\/bottle = $24 \n\n6 packs of cloths x $5\/pack = $30 \n\nHis total expenses will be $54. \n\nKim's total income each week is $92, so his profit will be: \n\nProfit = Total Income - Total Expenses \n\nProfit = $92 - $54 \n\nProfit = $38 \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'the profit is $38'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

So in total, Calvin needs 4 bowls of soup for his family.\n\nCalvin's pot of soup can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since Calvin needs 4 adult's bowls, this means the pot has enough soup to fill 2 child's bowls as well (since 4 adult's bowls is half of 8 child's bowls).\n\nTherefore, after Calvin's family eats, there will be 2 child's bowls of soup left.

The total number of outfits is dependent on the specific value of x, which we derived earlier. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nthe answer is Laurel has 24 baby outfits from her friend, plus twice the number of outfits she received at her baby shower, plus 15 more outfits from her mom. The total number of outfits is (total number of baby outfits - 39), where x is the number of new baby outfits Laurel received at her baby shower.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Since he makes mac and cheese once a week, he makes it 52 times a year.\nLet x be the number of boxes of pasta Bud uses in a year.\nThen, the cost of the pasta is 1.00 * x.\nThe cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.\nThe cost of the gruyere cheese is twice that amount, so it is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.\nThe total cost of making mac and cheese for a year is the sum of these costs, so:\n1.00x + $3.00 + $6.00 = total cost\nSimplifying:\n1.00x + $9.00 = total cost\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nTo find the total cost, we need to solve for x and then substitute it into the equation we came up with:\n1.00x + $9.00 = total cost\nTo find x, we know that Bud uses one box of pasta per mac and cheese dish, and he makes it 52 times a year, so x = 52.\nSubstituting x = 52:\n1.00(52) + $9.00 = total cost\n52 + $9.00 = total cost\n$61.00 = total cost\nTherefore, the answer is \"the answer is $61.00.\"\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

If we let \"x\" represent the number of red shoe boxes he uses, we can write:\n\n3 blue boxes used + x red boxes used = total boxes used\n3 + (1\/3)x = total boxes used\n\nFinally, we want to know how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim has left after going fishing, so we can use the following equations:\n\nb - 3 = number of blue boxes left\nr - x = number of red boxes left\n\nStep 2: \n\nTo solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation 3 + (1\/3)x = total boxes used by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n9 + x = 3(total boxes used)\n\nNext, we can substitute b = 7 and r = 9 into the equation for the number of boxes used:\n\n9 + x = 3(3 + (1\/3)x)\n9 + x = 9 + x\n\nThis equation doesn't give us any useful information, so we need to try a different approach. We know that Tim used 3 blue shoe boxes, so after fishing he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

We calculated that 2x kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, so (1\/4) * 2x = x\/2 additional kernels popped from residual heat.\n\nTherefore, the total number of kernels that popped and can be eaten is:\n\n8x + 20 + x\/2 = 16x\/2 + 20 + x\/2 = 8.5x + 20\n\nSo the answer is: 'the answer is 8.5x + 20'.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

This can be written as:\n\n30y - (20x + 2x) = 400\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n30y - 22x = 400\n\nWe now have an algebraic system of equations. To solve for y, we need to have another equation. We know that the trader bought x bags and sold y bags, so:\n\ny = x - unsold bags\n\nWe can substitute this into the previous equation:\n\n30(x - unsold bags) - 22x = 400\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n8x - 30unsold bags = 400 - 30(unsold bags)\n\n8x - 400 = 22unsold bags\n\nunsold bags = (8x - 400) \/ 22\n\nSince all the bags were eventually sold, we know that the number of unsold bags is 0. Thus:\n\n(8x - 400) \/ 22 = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n8x - 400 = 0\n\n8x = 400\n\nx = 50\n\nTherefore, the trader bought 50 bags from the farmer. We can now use the equation y = x - unsold bags to find the number of bags sold:\n\ny = 50 - (8(50) - 400) \/ 22\n\ny = 25\n\nThe answer is 25.

We'll use the equation for hybrid sets since it has the simplest coefficient for s.\n\nh = 0.5(18) = 9 (since it takes 18 minutes to string a hybrid set, which is half synthetic gut and half polyester string)\n\nSubstituting this value for h and the expression for s into the equation for polyester string, we get:\n\n5p + 4((183 - 5p - 4(9))\/3) = 183\n5p + (732 - 20p - 96)\/3 = 183\n15p + 636 = 549\n15p = -87\np = -5.8\n\nThis is a nonsensical answer since we can't have negative time.
