Then we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 2 = 5(80)\n\nThis equation represents the fact that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has (which is represented by \"x\"), and that this total number of toys (x + 2) needs to be equal to five times the number of toys James has (which is 80).\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 2 = 400\nx = 398\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Jonathan currently has 398 toys.\"\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

We know he runs for a total of 3 days, so the total distance he runs is: 20 + 10t + 10t = 60\n- Simplifying the second equation, we get: 20t = 40\n- Solving for t, we get: t = 2\n\nNow we can plug in t = 2 into the second equation to find the speed:\n10 x 2 x 2 + 20 = 60\n40 + 20 = 60\nr = 1.5\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nThe answer is John runs at a speed of 1.5 mph.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we need 20\/4 = 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so 5 sandwiches require:\n- 5 pounds of meat\n- 5 pounds of cheese\n\nLet's use variables to represent the cost of meat and cheese:\n- Let x be the cost of 1 pound of meat\n- Let y be the cost of 1 pound of cheese\n\nWe can now set up a system of equations to represent the cost of the meat and cheese:\n- 5x = total cost of meat\n- 5y = total cost of cheese\n\nWe know that the total cost of meat and cheese combined is what we are trying to find. So we can add the two equations together to get:\n- 5x + 5y = total cost of meat and cheese\n\nStep 2:\nTo solve for the total cost of meat and cheese, we need to find the values of x and y. We know that x = $7.00 per pound and y = $3.00 per pound. So we can substitute these values into our equation:\n- 5x + 5y = total cost of meat and cheese\n- 5($7.00) + 5($3.00) = total cost of meat and cheese\n- $35.00 + $15.00 = total cost of meat and cheese\n- $50.00 = total cost of meat and cheese\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"the answer is $50.00\".\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

That means they ate (2\/3)B pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 12*(2\/3)B = 8B slices.\n\nSimilarly, we know that the two remaining friends ate 3\/4 of their pizzas. That means they ate (3\/4)R pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 12*(3\/4)R = 9R slices.\n\nFinally, we know that the total number of pizza slices left is equal to the total number of pizza slices minus the number of pizza slices eaten:\n12T - 8B - 9R = ?\n\nStep 2: Final answer\nWe need more information to solve the problem. We don't know the values of T, B, and R. However, we can make a few observations:\n- We know that T = B + R, since there were no other friends who ordered pizza.\n- We know that there were 5 people in total who ordered pizza, so T = 5.\n\nUsing these observations, we can solve for B and R:\nT = B + R\n5 = B + R\n\nWe also know that Bryce and his two friends ordered the same amount of pizza as the two remaining friends, so:\nB = R\n\nSubstituting B = R into the equation above, we get:\n5 = 2B\nB = 2.5\n\nTherefore, Bryce and his two friends ordered 2.5 pizzas, and the two remaining friends also ordered 2.5 pizzas.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the equation we derived earlier to get the final answer:\n12T - 8B - 9R = ?\n12(5) - 8(2.5) - 9(2.5) = 60 - 20 - 22.5 = 17.5\n\nSo the answer is: \"the number of slices of pizza left is 17.5\". Note that this is a bit of an odd answer, since pizza slices are usually counted as whole numbers. We could say that there were either 17 or 18 slices left, depending on how we round.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Let's use the first equation:\n35((100\/3350)total weekly salary + (3\/3350)annual salary) + 15y = total weekly salary\n\nSimplifying and solving for y:\ny = (1\/15)(total weekly salary - (35\/3)((100\/3350)total weekly salary + (3\/3350)annual salary))\ny = (1\/15)(total weekly salary - (350\/67)total weekly salary - (30\/67)annual salary)\ny = (1\/201)(-350total weekly salary + 30annual salary)\n\nTherefore, Jill's annual salary is:\nannual salary = 50x + 50y\nannual salary = 50((100\/3350)total weekly salary + (3\/3350)annual salary) + 50((1\/201)(-350total weekly salary + 30annual salary))\nannual salary = (5000\/67)total weekly salary + (150\/67)annual salary\n\nSimplifying and solving for annual salary:\n(517\/67)annual salary = (5000\/67)total weekly salary\nannual salary = (5000\/517)total weekly salary\n\nSubstituting the given values of weekly hours and rates, we get:\ntotal weekly salary = 700 + 450 = $<<700+450=1150>>1150\nannual salary = (5000\/517)1150 = $<<5000\/517*1150=11161.048689138576>>11,161.05\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'Jill's annual salary is $11,161.05.'\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Let x be the number of hours it takes Matthew to dig a small hole and y be the number of hours it takes him to dig a large hole. We know that he can dig 1 small hole in 3 minutes, which is equivalent to 1\/20 of an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). We also know that he can dig 1 large hole in 10 minutes, which is equivalent to 1\/6 of an hour. \n\nUsing this information, we can set up a system of equations:\n1\/20x + 1\/6y = 30 + 15  (the left-hand side represents the time it takes to dig all the holes)\nx + y = total number of hours \n\nStep 2: Now we need to solve for x and y. Let's start by simplifying the first equation:\nMultiply both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators (60) to get rid of the fractions:\n3x + 10y = 900\nSimplify the second equation:\nx + y = total number of hours\n\nWe don't know the total number of hours, but we can simplify the problem by adding the number of hours it takes to dig a small hole 30 times and the number of hours it takes to dig a large hole 15 times:\n30(1\/20x) + 15(1\/6y) = total number of hours\n3\/2x + 5\/2y = total number of hours\n\nNow we have two equations:\n3x + 10y = 900\n3\/2x + 5\/2y = total number of hours\n\nWe can solve for x in the second equation:\n3\/2x = total number of hours - 5\/2y\nx = 2\/3(total number of hours) - 5\/6y\n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n3(2\/3(total number of hours) - 5\/6y) + 10y = 900\n2(total number of hours) - 5y + 10y = 900\n2(total number of hours) + 5y = 900\n2(total number of hours) = 900 - 5y\ntotal number of hours = 450 - 5\/2y\n\nNow we have expressions for x and total number of hours in terms of y. We can substitute these into the equation for the total number of hours in terms of x and y:\n3\/2x + 5\/2y = 450 - 5\/2y\n3\/2x = 450 - 5y\nx = (900 - 10y)\/3\n\nSo it takes Matthew (900 - 10y)\/3 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.\n\nStep 3: We want to find the total amount of time in hours, so we need to substitute y = 1 (since we're digging one large hole) and solve for x:\nx = (900 - 10(1))\/3 = 296.6667\/60 = 4.944 hours\n\nThe answer is 4.944 hours.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Each set of shelves consists of one middle shelf, one bottom shelf, and one top shelf.\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum number of sets of shelves that can be made with the given number of books. Since each set of shelves requires one middle shelf, one bottom shelf, and one top shelf, we can set up the following inequality:\n\nx \u2264 y \u2264 z\n\nThis means that the number of middle shelves can be no greater than the number of bottom shelves, and the number of bottom shelves can be no greater than the number of top shelves.\n\nWe can also use the equation we derived earlier to eliminate one of the variables:\n\n20x + 20y + 15z = 110\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\n4x + 4y + 3z = 22\n\nNow we can use trial and error to find the maximum number of sets of shelves that can be made with the given number of books. We can start with x = 0 and y = 1, since we need at least one bottom shelf. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n4(0) + 4(1) + 3z = 22\n3z = 18\nz = 6\n\nSo we can make one set of shelves with x = 0, y = 1, and z = 6. We can then try x = 1 and y = 1:\n\n4(1) + 4(1) + 3z = 22\n3z = 14\nz = 4.67\n\nThis is not an integer, so we need to try a different value for y. If we set y = 2, we get:\n\n4(1) + 4(2) + 3z = 22\n3z = 10\nz = 3.33\n\nAgain, this is not an integer, so we need to try a different value for y. If we set y = 3, we get:\n\n4(1) + 4(3) + 3z = 22\n3z = 6\nz = 2\n\nThis gives us two sets of shelves with x = 1, y = 3, and z = 2. We could keep trying different values, but we can see that we won't be able to make any more sets of shelves with the remaining books. So the answer is:\n\nthe answer is 2 bookcases.\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":null}

Then we have:\nP = L * P_per_letter\nWe don't know the value of P_per_letter yet, but we can use the information given about Mike's writing speed to figure it out.
