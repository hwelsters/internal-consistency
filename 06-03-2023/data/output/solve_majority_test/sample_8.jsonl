Therefore, their initial amounts of money are:\n    - Herman: 125 - y\n    - Chandra: 80 - x\n- Equation 2: After buying the ticket, Mr. Herman had six times as much money as Mr. Chandra. Therefore:\n    - Herman: 6(80 - x - y)\n    - Chandra: 125 - x - y\n\nStep 2:\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Here, we will use substitution:\n- Equate the two expressions for Herman: \n    6(80 - x - y) = 125 - x - y\n- Simplify and solve for y:\n    480 - 6x - 6y = 125 - x - y\n    5x - 5y = 355\n    x - y = 71\n    y = x - 71\n- Substitute y into one of the equations for Herman, and solve for x:\n    6(80 - x - (x - 71)) = 125 - x - (x - 71)\n    960 - 12x = 54\n    x = 77\n\nNow that we know x (the amount Mr. Chandra spent on the ticket), we can find how much money he has left:\nChandra's initial amount: 80\nMinus the ticket price: -77\nLeftover: $3\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Mr. Chandra had $3 left.\""}
