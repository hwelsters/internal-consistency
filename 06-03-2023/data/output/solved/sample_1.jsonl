We can create the following system of equations:\n\np + w = 485  (since the plane had a tailwind on the way to San Diego)\np - w = 275  (since the plane had a headwind on the return trip)\n\nTo solve for p and w, we can add these two equations together. The w terms will cancel out, leaving us with:\n\n2p = 760\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\np = 380\n\nNow we can plug this value back into one of the original equations (let's use the first one) to solve for w:\n\n380 + w = 485\nw = 105\n\nTherefore, the speed of the plane in still air is 380 mph and the speed of the wind is 105 mph.\n\nThe answer is 'the speed of the plane in still air is 380 mph and the speed of the wind is 105 mph.'\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"{a: 380, b: 105}","flag":"OK"}

The distance they cover is 140 km, and the time it takes to meet is 48 minutes (or 0.8 hours). Therefore, we can write:\n\n140 = (r1 + r2) * 0.8\n\nWhen the cars are driven in the same direction, they are getting farther apart at a rate of r2 - r1. The distance they cover is also 140 km, but this time it takes 240 minutes (or 4 hours) to meet. Therefore, we can write:\n\n140 = (r2 - r1) * 4\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of r1 and r2.\n\nStep 2: Final Answer\n\nLet's rewrite the equations in a more convenient form:\n\n0.8r1 + 0.8r2 = 140\/1\n4r2 - 4r1 = 140\/1\n\nWe can use the second equation to express r2 in terms of r1:\n\n4r2 = 4r1 + 140\/1\nr2 = r1 + 35\/4\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\n0.8r1 + 0.8(r1 + 35\/4) = 140\/1\n1.6r1 + 28 = 140\/1\n1.6r1 = 112\/1\nr1 = 70\/4\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the first car is driven is 17.5 km\/h (since the distance is in km and the time is in hours). Using the equation we derived for r2:\n\nr2 = r1 + 35\/4\nr2 = 17.5 + 35\/4\nr2 = 32.5\/4\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the second car is driven is 8.125 km\/h.\n\nThe answer is: 'the rate at which the first car is driven is 17.5 km\/h, and the rate at which the second car is driven is 8.125 km\/h.'\n\n\n","n":1,"temperature":0.7,"solved":"FREE VARIABLE[]","flag":"FREE"}

Then we have the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 10000 (since he invested all $10,000)\n0.05x + 0.09y = 660 (since his annual income from the investments was $660)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use substitution or elimination.
